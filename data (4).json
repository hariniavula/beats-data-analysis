The sound quality is a good neutral range, with it being a rather flat in the frequency response, but with some extra sound in the treble. It‚Äôs not a bad thing, it‚Äôs more reminiscent of the Beats Solo Pro. That said though, in plain terms it means if you want a more bass heavy set of headphones, then this might not be the best for you. There isn‚Äôt any noise cancelling either, though personally I don‚Äôt mind too much as I don‚Äôt prefer active noise cancelling. There is spatial head tracking though, and it‚Äôs pretty fun to play with.I do like the case and how it‚Äôs pretty portable. It fits easily into a small backpack, and the battery life lasts as long as you do really. I listen to music frequently throughout the day, and I can honestly go a few days, specifically 3-4 depending on use, without needing to charge. I can see this also being good for traveling as well because of it. It‚Äôs also a nice looking pair of headphones, and built with quality materials. It feels sturdy on me, and while I mostly use it at home, I would feel comfortable walking with it places.Overall, I‚Äôd recommend for a decent daily driver headphone.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024","profile_id":"AH35JWVQOH6GNEOZ5AXBB7EH5S3A","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Cloud PinkStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R2RS13BS5IQS8B","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Clear sound and great fit!","author":"Sandy Beach","rating":5,"content":"The cloud pink color is subtle and light, great color that is not overpowering.

Impossible to wear for long.","author":"Ronald Ellis","rating":3,"content":"I had high hopes for this item. Had great reviews.I really liked the sound. It's not in the 'top notch' category, but it's excellent for the price. The battery life is really incredible....40+ hours...wow. Although I wish I had read the fine print, and assumed that most Apple type products have the 'sound through' option, or touching a button and being able to hear externally. This one's on me for not checking.The only issue (a big one), is that these are EXTREMELY uncomfortable on your ears for more than a short amount of time. I wore them for about 2 hours on a plane to watch a movie, and kept fidgeting with them for comfort. When I arrived, on the bus trip to the destination, I really thought that I had an ear infection from how achy one of my ears was. It faded after an hour or so, but the cushions are so small that they can only sit on top of the ears, not around them. Just didn't work for me.I tried to give them to one of my daughters with smaller ears, and she refused within 15 minutes as she could tell immediately that they would hurt over time.This is just an FYI for anyone who might consider these. Short term, awesome, long term, no no. My advice is that if you are in the market for headphones, save your pennies for the higher end over the ears.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2024","profile_id":"AHONXEWM6GVKYOCZNUQ2VR3GG5SQ","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R3272XSZYCIXWE","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones","author":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"content":"Been looking for a good set of headphones for a while, as I really don‚Äôt like earbuds.

Caruso","rating":3,"content":"I have always been one to ignore Beats headphones, but recently, I decided to try a pair of the Beats Studio Pros because they were on an irresistible sale. I was more impressed with them than I thought, even with some of their shortcomings.Which is why I decided to give the new Solo 4s a try. For me, these simply didn't have enough for me to keep them in my collection, particularly given that I own the Studio Pros.Recently, I have become a fan of on-ear headphones (as distinct from over-ear). I own the Skullcandy Riff 2, the Sony WH-CH520, and the JBL Live 670. The Solo 4s are the only ones I've returned. And it's not because they were so offensive or horrible; they simply didn't add anything to my collection.First of all, the clamping force was inordinately tight for my head. Normally, this doesn't bother me. But these simply were too uncomfortable from the moment I put them on, and they only got worse the longer I wore them.Then there was the sound. Like I said, I own the Beats Studio Pros, and have an appreciation for what they are and what they do. Even though they don't have the ability to be EQed, which I prefer, I like them in and of themselves and enjoy the sound they provide. The Solo 4s are similar in that they are a what-you-get-is-what-you-get sound. In this case, however, I found myself wishing for an equalizer. They sounded thin and harsh, not full like the Studio Pros.When I compared them to my other Bluetooth headphones, I couldn't justify keeping them in the collection. To be fair, there was a lot to like about them: the iPhone and Android compatibility, the folding design, the carrying case, and the look/style. However, the comfort and sound were just too much of a negative for me.I can see that many people will like these a lot, and I'm glad. They fill a niche and they fill it well. But for me, there are just too many other options I like better.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024","profile_id":"AF6PWT7PYEOVDQDJQX5Q64767SNQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":45,"product_attributes":"Color: Cloud PinkStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R2AG78U6STS1UM","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars No charger port","author":"Crystal Crawford","rating":4,"content":"The color is awesome I got the blue slate a lot of compliments because it stands out !

The charging cable that comes with it will need an additional connection so just get it. i wasnt thrilled about that! be sure and read carefully. i thought who doesnt include USB chargers now?? The black case included is so hard to get hand in that I almost broke headphones getting them out. I am a small woman and could barely get my hand in? why? adding a couple of inches to the zipper would have been so nice. i will have to switch out the case with my retiring Beats 3.

The construction is high quality, and the materials feel and look great. They also have no issue staying on when exercising, and don't stick too far out from the ears.Battery life is also great, even when only used in noise canceling mode. I only use mine for about an hour at time when working out, but so far I've only had to charge a few times.My main complaint is that out of the box, the audio is incredibly underwhelming. Very shallow and drowned out, and it feels like the gain is *way* down, so it's rather quiet at max volume. I'm able to hear my feet on the treadmill with the default audio at high volume, even in noise canceling. This is mitigated by using the equalizer included in my phone software, but not every phone has that option and even fewer people would know how to do it. So these aren't terribly user friendly in that regard.Then theres the required Beats app. The app doesn't offer any real utility; no audio presets or way to adjust the headphones beyond registering for warranty, changing the hardware name, or buying more beats products... So that's a bit useless bloat.For the high price tag I think there are better options. But these are still competitive, and if you're already in the Beats ecosphere, these are fine.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024","profile_id":"AHSVWQZPUMOQAHBOO5LYG2RIFUSA","is_verified":false,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"RVM3XGRJLQGOK","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Battery Life but Sound Quality Could be Better","author":"Replica","rating":4,"content":"Pros:Physical Control ButtonsLong Battery LifeAmazing Bluetooth RangeNatural Noise IsolationCons:Sound quality does not match priceNo Active Noise CancellingThe Beats Solo 4 are good but not great headphones. The sound quality is not bad but was disappointing at this price point. Compared to the Sony WH-CH720N, they sound thin and hollow. The highs come through nicely but mid range is not as strong in the mix. The bass is nicely balanced, not overpowering like other Beats headphones I have tried.Where the Beats Solo 4 headphones excel is in the battery life that last longer than any other wireless headphones I have used. The Bluetooth range was also amazingly good. I often forget my phone somewhere while walking around the house on the phone or listening to music, causing the signal to start dropping out. I was able to go everywhere in my house with these on without any degradation to the sound. I am a big fan of the physical buttons. They do what I expect when I click them. I always have trouble with touch buttons registering the correct number of clicks.At this price, I would have expected the Beats Solo 4 to have the Active Noise Cancelling feature, which is missing. They do fit snugly and naturally block a lot of outside noises. The Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking only works on Apple devices even though that feature is available on Android with other headphones.Call quality has been good. No one I have called has mentioned that I sound different so I take that to mean that it works as well as my usual ear buds. I like having the option for the 3.5 audio cable to use on certain planes. The headphones fold down into a nice case. It is still a little large when traveling, but not much more than others.The Beats Solo 4 are decent headphones with some nice features. They are not a good value at MSRP, but that could change when they are on sale.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2024","profile_id":"AEOFSOVSHRAVZ5DUAD7ZNCGIEZCA","is_verified":false,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R2OI4DTN3QZ475","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Good","author":"EDCamera","rating":4,"content":"I recently upgraded to the Beats Solo 4 Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every way!

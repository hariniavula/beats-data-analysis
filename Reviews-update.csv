R20IRE5X6WY351,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones!,Talia Calazans,5,"I love these headphones, and I wear them all the time. They are pretty comfortable and also very cute. They are not too bulky. The noise cancelling is not great at cancelling voices, it really just cancels out background hums, which was a bit frustrating, but does well enough on things like planes. Other than that the sound is pretty good (as someone who does not care much about super high quality sound so I'm pleased with not bad). Battery is good, will last me a few days of pretty extensive use. Bought these on sale for $70 and it was increadibly worth it for this price.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AG6TODKB7VQYDH7KJ2MKHF6RQEGA,True,7,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3,
RFGOLBEISEB55,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones!,Leosha Williams,5,"These headphones are absolutely amazing! The volume, how they fit, the price, all top tier! I was stuck between these and the solo 3’s. I did my research and saw that the Solo 3’s can get uncomfortable after a while and that they don’t have noise cancellation. So I switched my focus onto the studios, and I'm glad that I did. The quality of these headphones is phenomenal! The bass sounds great. The headphones already drown outside noise out, but then when you cut the Actuve noise cancellation on, it’s like you’re in the world alone. I really couldn’t hear anything. Another plus is the fact that I have 21 days to add AppleCare+ to them. All of my products are protected with Applecare+ and this one will be as well. I definitely recommend these headphones if you’re looking for a great pair with noise cancellation and great studio sound! 10/10!","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFBT2YGFVT6CBITOKGANUEJ5WYHA,True,8,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3,
R2399XIITPW93N,5.0 out of 5 stars Works great,Max Rundell,5,"They are sleek and great value for the money you spend. There are a lot of different headphones you can buy, but as far as over the ear headphones these are great. Very light, get a little discomfort after long use, but not bad at all. Sound is great quality especially for the gym which is my main use for these. Just be sure to wash the ear pads if you do this. Comes with an aux cord as well incase you need to hook them up differently than Bluetooth.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AGONEWJIIDADSFNMIJQESOKWVG3A,True,1,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3,

R2AGD67A8P04AC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones, just don't fit my big ears.",Jacob,4,"Jan 2023 - First, I am not an audiophile. So, this review will not be super technical, just an average Joe who doesn't mind paying for quality products.I did quite a bit of research before buying my next set of headphones. I read tons of reviews on Amazon and the web. I read multiple ""review/ratings"" articles online that compared numerous headphones. Ultimately, I decided to buy these because I have an iPhone and AppleTV that they work seamlessly with, and they were always rated highly at their price point.I've used them for about 2 months now. They were simple to pair with my iPhone. When I am in my living room with my AppleTV on and I turn them on, my AppleTV asks me if I want to pair them, and they have done that easily every single time. I love this seamless functionality.I use them at work primarily. I work in office with 20+ cubes. I use them often simply for the noise-canceling to stay focused, and I use them just as often to listen to podcasts and music. When in noise-canceling mode, they do not remove 100% of every sound around you. No headphones can (that I am aware of). But, they do a great job creating a virtually noise free environment with a light ""white noise"" in the background (similar to a fan in the distance). You can turn noise-canceling off, and then the noises around you are simply muffled (if you're not actively playing something on the device you're connected to).As mentioned previously, I listen to podcasts, music, and watch TV and movies with these. I think they sound fantastic with all of these. Occasionally, they do sound just a tiny bit bass-heavy for some of the music I listen to or during movies with high-action scenes that have a lot of explosions, but that's just me I guess. Some people probably prefer that with the music/media they have.My one peeve is that they don't completely fit over my ears. The good news is the cushions on the earcups are super soft. So, I can still wear them comfortably... for hours. This doesn't seem to affect the noise-canceling at all.Lastly, they seem to have a really good battery life with my usage style. I use them for varying lengths of time. At work, it's not uncommon to get interrupted and need to turn them off after 5-10 mins because I need to step away from my desk, and sometimes I will have them on for 2+ hours. At home, I often use them at night to watch stuff on my AppleTV so that I don't take a chance of waking up my kids while they are sleeping, and I can get hours of watch time in without needing to charge them (as long as they weren't close to being dead already).If you can get them on sale (like I did: $170), I wouldn't hesitate to buy them, and I saw them on sale a lot (but the sale price varied quite a bit) leading up to my purchase. I don't even think their regular price is all that bad for what you get.","Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2023",AH3SC2BAKM6AA7XJMTJ4KAET6MSQ,True,91,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3,
R1UVTRVZ4F5DME,5.0 out of 5 stars LONG battery life.,Julian,5,"I recently invested in the Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, and the experience has been nothing short of exceptional. These headphones effortlessly blend style, comfort, and cutting-edge technology, creating a remarkable auditory journey for music lovers and audiophiles alike.The standout feature of the Beats Studio3 is its impressive noise-canceling capability. The headphones effectively block out external sounds, providing an immersive and uninterrupted listening experience. Whether I'm in a noisy commute, a bustling café, or even on an airplane, the noise-canceling feature allows me to escape into my music without being disturbed by the outside world.Comfort is paramount during prolonged use, and the Beats Studio3 excels in this aspect. The over-ear design, combined with plush ear cushions, ensures a snug fit without causing discomfort or pressure. The headphones are lightweight, making them ideal for extended listening sessions without causing fatigue. The adjustable headband allows for a customized fit, ensuring a secure and comfortable feel.The sound quality of the Beats Studio3 is exceptional. The headphones deliver a robust and well-balanced audio experience, with crisp highs, rich mids, and powerful lows. The bass response, a signature of the Beats brand, adds depth to the music without overpowering other frequencies. Whether I'm listening to energetic beats or soothing melodies, the audio reproduction is consistently impressive.The integration of Apple's W1 chip enhances the overall user experience. The seamless pairing process with Apple devices is a breeze, and the Class 1 Bluetooth connectivity provides a stable and reliable connection. The efficiency of the W1 chip also contributes to an extended battery life, allowing for up to 22 hours of playback on a single charge.The on-ear controls add a layer of convenience to the user experience. Adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and managing calls can be done effortlessly with intuitive controls located on the ear cups. The incorporation of Siri support allows for hands-free control, adding an extra layer of functionality.The durability and build quality of the Beats Studio3 are commendable. The premium materials used in construction give the headphones a sleek and sophisticated look, while also ensuring resilience to everyday wear and tear. The foldable design and included carrying case enhance portability, making them a practical choice for on-the-go lifestyles.","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024",AHUVU5TLJQFQMZKFR7YKDB55USPA,True,22,Color: Midnight BlackSet: Studio3,
R1SMSYH9JKNH51,"5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive Sound Quality, but Lacking in Bass",prashant naik,5,"The Beats Studio headphones deliver impressive sound quality overall, with clear highs and detailed mids. However, I found them to be lacking in bass compared to other headphones in this price range. While the sound is well-balanced, bass enthusiasts may find it underwhelming. Despite this drawback, the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, with excellent noise isolation. If you prioritize balanced sound over heavy bass, these headphones are worth considering. Four stars.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AF7TF3C7U74FMUFC2FGM6GTADYMA,True,4,Color: Midnight BlackSet: Studio3,
R1H100TYFQZJLK,2.0 out of 5 stars Please Read Before Buying.,O.Winnie Mittelberger,2,"My rating falls close to a 1.5 for multiple reasons:For starters, this headphone is marketed and sold as an ANC (Active Noise Cancelling), Over-Ear headphone. Typically, headphones like these are targeting people who buy them for travel (i.e. a plane ride) but also are helpful in any public space. Please keep this in mind for the rest of my comment. From the inside out, these headphones cannot hold their own with any other pair in the price range.I purchased my pair when they were 57% off, bringing the total from $350 to $160 (including tax), but I cannot in good conscious recommend them for either price bracket. Comparing them to the most common headphone in the $350 bracket, the Sony XM4 (and newly the XM5) are a essentially the opposite side of the spectrum when it comes to all qualities. They clearly lose the battle for acceptable headphones to buy for $350, but some could make a case for the discounted price.Everything I found wrong with the Beats (most to least important):- Sound quality is mediocre.I attribute this to the old design (nearing 3 years) and old parts (Apples W1 chip is long outclassed by the newest chips)With that said, I am also no audiophile (someone who has a keen skill/desire for high quality sound) but I can make general observations about the sound quality from the Studio3's. I can't give an super detailed review of the sound quality because I only listened to ~3 songs and maybe 2 videos. But I can say is the trope that ""Beats just overbass their headphones"" isn't true. I can't say what you find as a proper balance of bass, but to me it seemed fined and not too far one way or the other. But you can tell that the timbre wasn't all that it could be. For the MSRP listed, this should not be case, even for an old design that was adopted and revamped by Apple.- ANC, one of the primary marketing points, is horrible.This is comes from a variety of reasons other than just poor build quality, after reading into the making of the Studio 3's, Beats tried making an early ""adaptive"" ANC by changing the way sound is measured, processed, and then cancelled.However, it fails completely and everything from your fingertips rubbing together at arms length, to a pencil dropping behind a closed door is essentially the same with/without ANC on.The only different is bass is slightly toned down, you don't feel like constantly pressure that other ANC headphones give (kinda like you're in an airplane at max altitude), but you hear a slight ""woosh"" constantly.- As mentioned before, build quality as a whole is terrible.Straight out the box, the right earcup is crumpled a towards the bottom because of a poorly designed folding mechanism that squishes the earcup against the headband as it's packed into the case. The earcups themselves have this cheap, fake leather look and feel, the stitching is far apart and looks poorly made, the earcup foam is obviously cheap, it easily compresses (therefore there's a lot of air) but then refills as if the foam itself isn't compact but just large pockets of air (meaning the foam itself is low quality), and the size of the earcups is very small for over-the-ear headphones. So if you happen to be ok with everything I mention, having medium-big ears will already make the experience impossible to begin with.The top headband, a common weakpoint that's overlooked in headphone design, has literally no cushioning.They didn't even use the foam from the earcups, it's rubber on the outside (when slightly damp or if it just came off someone's head) feels comparable to a pencil eraser. There is a little give to the headband but the material underneath is too thin for me to discern from just pushing down.After wearing the headphones, straight from the box, you could start ""feeling"" the headband begin pressing into your head after ~1 hour, then feel that annoying soreness after ~1.5 hours of total listening. Once again, considering travel or just extended use would be expected of a $350 headphone, there were too many bad choice they let slide.With the buttons provided on the headphone, there is one good but a few bad things.Firstly, Beats Studio3 happen to be one of the few headphones in this bracket that have a distinct power button. But the action button and touch pad are the main concern I found.A lot of online reviews will say the action button (the beats logo) feels cheap and totally disrupts the hearing experience, but I can't say I completely agree. I do like a tactile button, but the button provided has a distinct and somewhat loud click. It doesn't inherently sound cheap nor satisfying to me, but that's partly subjective. However, you can hear the click very clearly when you are wearing them so if that's something you dislike, and you'd prefer a touchpad then be aware of that.One of my most concerning observations for the build was the Micro USB charger in the headphones. A lot of online reviewers bash on the cable that's provided to charge the Studio3 pair, but I don't mind that they were able to pack some ginormous cable because I can plug in the USB A into a nearby port for close charging. However, the choice for Micro USB charging as a whole is a bad idea to me. Micro USB is getting very old now, being outshined by Lighting and USB C when it comes to things like charging speed, data transfer speed, etc. But my main concern is durability. Again, a $350 pair of headphones should essentially guarantee you multiple years of use. I didn't fully test the battery life of the pair, but over my years of use with Micro USB I know that the cable itself can corrode but most importantly if the input port (like the one that built into the headphones) doesn't have good glue to hold it to the plastic inside of the earcup, then the port can pop out can render the charging useless. In the first example of the cable breaking with time, I'm sure a lot of people have old Micro USB cables laying around, but if the input port falls out, then you will be forced to use the provided AUX cord for the headphones (can't listen to portless devices like modern iPhones).- All the other complaints were at least somewhat merited regarding an expensive headphone. But this one is mostly based on aesthetic.Of these entirely subjective points, the most relatable would be the bulky carrying case the headphones come in. It's very wide and rounded, so it definitely won't sit in a backpack or carry-on without taking up unnecessary space. But if the case was designed to be wider/longer but slimmer (like the Sony XM4's) it could slide into thinner pockets without stretching out the bag. Also, forcing the headphones into a smaller but thicker case is what causes that earcup compression problem I mentioned earlier.The scale of the headphones looks off. From product pictures to models wearing them, the headphones look really nice and stylish. I bought the matte black pair, and I was excited to see how they looked. But they pair overall seems smaller than what you expected (like how I briefly mentioned the small earcups). The overall look seems like it could only give that proper ""Beats"" look on certain people with specific head sizes/shapes.If you happen to find this pair on sale, don't really care too much about noise cancelling, want a listening experience that is good but you don't mind if it isn't groundbreaking, but want a pair of headphones for more of the luxury aspect, then it wouldn't seem like a bad deal to buy these.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2022",AH46ZHN22ZKGHWOM3UMMORBATP2Q,True,928,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3,

Whenever he comes over here, he has one side on his ear (to listen to the music), and the other side beside his other ear (so he can talk to us). He doesn't seem to have any problem talking with us or anyone else, while still listening to music in the other ear.

RWKQ50TITGDCR,5.0 out of 5 stars I’m converted,Blair,5,"I always figured that with my tin ears that spending more than $75 for noise cancelling headphones was wasting money. But when I saw this Beats item for $168, I decided to take a chance since this was a lot lower price for Beats headphones than I had ever seen. I was blown away by the sound and noise cancellation of this unit over my previous units. When you don’t have anything playing on them, the noise cancellation is on a par with my previous units, but when you use them for music or a phone call you are COMPLETELY isolated. I am now a believer in Beats. I have drank the kool-aid.

RF2TYMPI9P6HY,4.0 out of 5 stars great headphones but probably not the most durable,Florin,4,"long-time beats user, this is the fourth pair i've had to buy. i wear them almost all day every day and have two pairs at a time so i can switch them out. partially for noise reduction as i have auditory sensitivity issues, and they work pretty well in that regard, at least at first, and partially for music. they last me usually two years before breaking or not working anymore, often within a month of the repair/replace warranty thing running out. one pair stopped working entirely, the sound just didn't work and one side of the size adjusting mechanism (which i never use) broke completely and i had to reattach with tape. the adjusting mechanism breaking happened with another pair as well, that pair still works sound-wise, though not as well. the battery, sound, and noise reduction quality begin to decrease after about a year in my experience, not sure how this compares to other brands. i've also had to replace the ear pads on a few because they get kinda shredded after two years of use. i should probably try other headphones but change is hard so i guess beats have a begrudgingly loyal customer in me.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2024",AELWQVTIVXHBNYPDPTWVWD2KNPQQ,True,1,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3,

R2GCZUGFSPN9GD,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent if you get them on sale,Derek Shoff,4,"I’ll start by saying that these are not worth the retail price of $350. But they often go on sale for around $170 which Is where they need to be priced at for the quality of sound you get. I ordered the grey with gold trim because they were the only ones on sale when I was in the market, which I do love th my is color but I really wanted the red ones. Which are now also on sale for the same price as the grey one. Added that into this review just to let you know if there is a certain color you want just be patient they will go on sale. Now with all that said a big part of the reason I bought these was the noise cancellation feature which is a joke. I have a $50 pair of over the ear onns that do a way better job of noise canceling than these do.so if you are buying for that feature alone I strongly advise you to look elsewhere. The sound quality is decent. It does not compare to a good pair of Bose but you will be paying double for a pair of Bose. As long as you get these on sale for $170 or less I think you’ll be happy with the purchase. The bass is a little disappointing I really expected it to thump from Beats by Dre. It is there you can hear it but it’s not great. The fact that these are Apple compatible was a big reason I bought them I can pair them and talk effortlessly when I get a phone call without ever taking my phone out of my pocket. The microphone is by no means great but the caller should be able to understand you as long as you speak loudly and clearly. If the overall look is something important to you than I imagine that’s why your shopping beats in the first place because they definitely look better than all of their competitors headphones. I will end this review with another huge reason as to why I settled on them personally and maybe you will to. These are built for people with smaller heads. I really wanted a good pair of headphones to work out in, that would stay on my head nice and tight and I knew from the reviews I read before buying that these would do just that. I imagine they can get a little uncomfortable for people with bigger heads because they do sit tight but they are perfect for me.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2023",AE3XXREQ27I334BJK2CTMG4A6UNA,True,54,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3,

I looked on the internet and it appears this is a major issue for Beats headphones and there is no way to fix it. Normally, I would say well sometimes things break. However, this is the second pair of Beats noise canceling headphones my son has had with the exact same issue. The first pair lasted a little longer, but he bought those with his own money. These headphone are too expensive to be breaking all the time. I expect better quality control from an expensive set of headphone. I will not be buying another pair of Beats headphones ever!

RNKST26GTRHD4,"4.0 out of 5 stars Solid ANC heaphones, at the right price",Mike Jankowski,4,"Update 9/17/2022: After I wrote the review I found that on Android there are EQ apps that will help tune headphones to help them sound better. I personally use Wavelet now and with that these do sound really good now and clear up some of my criticisms about the sound in the original review. That being said, I can't find anything similar for iOS, so keep that in mind!I'll mention first that I didn't buy these headphones at full price, or anything close to it. At their original MSRP ($350) look elsewhere and don't look back, these get blown away by Sony and Bose and others at that price point. Once you get down to about $200 though? These start to look more tempting.I already have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's which have amazing sound, but no ANC, so they're great for around the house, but I needed a pair with ANC for work travel, so I took a chance on the Beats on a sale, and at a sale price, I'm pretty happy with them.The sound isn't bad, I know I've heard other people say there isn't a whole lot of bass. It does seem like that varies heavily from song to song, some give a nice, but never muddy, thump, others do feel a little lacking. Highs are pretty nice and crisp and come through well, it's the mids on these headphones that tend to be a bit muddled. It's by no means bad, but I'm also comparing it to some pretty good can headphones in roughly the same price range and the Audio Technica's win hands down there.ANC is probably the best feature of the headphones. It does a great job of keeping out engine noise when flying. Sony and Bose will do better at the Beats original price point, but at a sale price they do a very good job. You will run into a few weird quirks of it, for example I could hear it fighting the noise of a rough road while on a rental car shuttle which made for an interesting effect, but largely it just works and keeps out the noise well.Battery life seems to be pretty much what they're rated for, so no complaints there and the build quality seems solid. When using the controls, you will hear a clicking sound from the press, which I know some people have criticized. But, despite that, the controls are easy and intuitive. The look of them is pretty nice as well, but it would be nice if the ear cups to rotate to be flat on your chest, but that's a minor nitpick.Finally, the great irony, these actually seem to work better on my personal Pixel phone than my work iPhone, despite being an Apple product. The Android Beats app allows for better control of the headphones and the ANC, not to mention actually giving you a battery percentage as opposed to just a circle that gives you an approximate value. And with the Beats app installed, the pairing process was just as easy on my Pixel as it was for my work phone.Overall, they're solid headphones, but wait to catch them at the right price.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2022",AF7GBXJT26ZTDSSQHDYSLC6KFJ6Q,True,126,Color: WhiteSet: Studio3,

The active noise cancellation is top-notch, effortlessly drowning out background noise, making them perfect for both commuting and focused work sessions. The transparency mode is equally impressive, allowing me to stay aware of my surroundings when needed without removing the headphones.The comfort level is exceptional. The memory foam ear cushions and the breathable knit mesh canopy ensure that I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. The seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem is a huge plus, making it incredibly easy to switch between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.Battery life is another highlight. I get well over 20 hours of continuous playback, and the quick charge feature provides hours of use from just a short charge. The intuitive controls and the impressive spatial audio feature further enhance the overall experience.In conclusion, the Apple AirPods Max are worth every penny. They offer an unparalleled combination of luxury, performance, and innovation. If you're looking for the best in audio quality and user experience, look no further. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2024",AFJI55LFMYZTTCWEJWOJKPWYYZSA,True,2,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R2IQ4PP549QRTG,5.0 out of 5 stars I’m impressed with this,Joe,5,"So, this is day one of having these so I’ll probably do an updated version of this.The headphone itself is sturdy, full of metal so it’ll be heavy be prepared for that but it’s not overbearing. It’s pretty heavy when taking it out of the box. The headband is mesh, so after a while it’s gonna become useless, so I’d get yourself a headband that’ll grab on the the existing one so then it can not wear and turn overtime, but it’s comfortable without it, just be warned.When taking them out of the case itself, the headphones will clank together, but no damage will happen. *Clank*The sound quality is great especially with the volume control on top of the right headphone. For my headphone users, they can sound quiet, but I assure you that it’s working just fine, that’s how it’s suppose to sound. You’ve got everything that the AirPod Pros have when it comes to the noise cancellation and the transparency, now I may have forgotten a system that the pros had but those are the two things this has.For my big head people, they fit you. They have enough room to fit out big heads.The buttons on the headphones are great to have with the functionality.The connection at first wasn’t great until I looked up how to fix it. So if you run into this problem, hit the 2 buttons on top of the right headphone for 5-8 seconds until you see a white light at the bottom of the headphones. This’ll factory reset it. Then it’ll appear on your phone. Then it’ll sound just like your pros when you put them on.The adjustment is great if you wanna have them on for hours at a time. Short time users are fine too.The headphones pieces are magnetic, so if you need to replace them, you actually can. Grab the earpiece and play with it to see.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHM4XENJHY6GVDLBR4F6LJBO2TTA,True,1,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R2YFAH2YNEJNK9,5.0 out of 5 stars Great bluetooth headphones,BMan,5,"Since I mostly work from home and listen to music when I'm not on the phone I use several bluetooth ear pods including AirPod Pros.The Max version has always intrigued me but I have quite a few over ear headphones so until they went on sale there was nothing compelling me to purchase them.I've had them long enough to break in the drivers to some degree. Yes like most dynamic headphones these need to be broken in for 20 to 50 hours before they can be judged for sound quality.1. I'm a headphone guy so sound quality is my first priority. This is an excellent headphone. They blow away my bluetooth Sennheisers on sound quality. They even compete with some wired headphones. They may not reach the level of my Grado 325's but they are much more comfortable. My Focal Clears, which incidentally match well with the output voltage of my iPhone, are superior but are much more expensive. And wired. BTW you can't get Lossless audio through Bluetooth so a wired headphone has that advantage. And you can't talk through the Clears. My wired Sennheisers don't really have the output levels to match an iPhone so they are not in the consideration. These have a wide range sonically and reproduce all kinds of music well. And unlike some Beats models they are not bass heavy. I think they work best with Spatial Audio off. iMy only complaint is that the midlevel sound stage is a bit compressed regardless of volume. Apple did their home work in designing these headphones. I'd go so far to say that you will not find another headphone wired or not that has as good as sound for the money.2. Comfort/Fit. One goes with the other. The head band is comfortable for my large head and does not squeeze my ears. The ear pad material is not what I'd like but it is surprisingly comfortable. Typical of any headphones they are best used without glasses for maximum comfortable. If you use glasses put the pads on your ears with the glasses on for maximum comfort. I do not notice any weight - these are much lighter than most wired headphones. The ear space fits my large ears although ideally a couple of extra mm's would be better.3. They connect easily once you go through the initial connection procedure. Most importantly they have excellent battery life. They have double or more battery life than Pros. Put them in the case when you are through with them for the day as it is the only way they turn off. You will otherwise lose battery life as they are otherwise constantly scanning for possible bluetooth targets. The case is not great but it works well for being put into a bag or backpack. Generally they do a good job of picking up your voice in telephone or FaceTime mode.4. They are an excellent value. Usually a substantial discount means that there is a newer model is coming out. My research suggests that is not the case. There is likely to be a newer model of the Pros coming out which explains their greater discount.I am very pleased with these headphones and I think that you will be equally as pleased.","Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2021",AGKBEX4N67YUFDH5IYNUQN4ZUAFA,True,165,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
ROXHO5NMT21UD,5.0 out of 5 stars ULTIMATE LISTENING EXPERIENCE,Nicholas Calderone,5,"After I perused the specs and got over the sticker shock of the price tag, I thought, “These might be worth the investment for me.” I have high-end hearing loss, and because of that, most speakers, earbuds, and headphones don’t do much for me. I have an especially hard time hearing dialogue on our TV unless the sound is being pumped through our HomePods. That is what caused me to pause and really consider the purchase. “What if the AirPods Max is like putting HomePods on your ears?” That was worth it to me.After setup was completed, I put the headphones on my ears and heard the first sounds through the AirPods Max. It was a Christmas song that I had heard dozens of times before. The sound was so rich, deep, and clear that it was like I was hearing the song for the first time. “Ok, there is no way these sound this good.” At that moment, Robyn, my fiance, walked into the room and said, “So, are they like having HomePods attached to your ears?” All I could do was nod yes. She gave me a look and I handed them over to her. She put the headphones on her ears and scrolled through my library until she found something she wanted to play. She then said she had to have a pair.When I test headphones, I have a few go-to songs I like to try out so that I can get an idea of the listening experience of the headphones from every angle. The songs are pulled from a variety of genres including soundtracks, rock, grunge, punk, classical, and even a bit of rap. The AirPods Max does an incredibly nice job with all of them. The headphones keep a nice, deep bass sound while protecting the integrity of the rest of the track. I also found that vocals are crisp as well and I really love that as I turn up the volume, that I don’t get any distortion. That’s not been the case with other headphones I’ve used.Overall, I’ve been impressed with all the features of the AirPods Max. Here’s a brief rundown of my thoughts on the main features of the headphones.Active Noise Canceling (ANC): Until I used the AirPods Max, the ANC on the Sony headphones was the best I’ve ever used. I took the Sony headphones on a flight a few years back and never heard the airplane’s engine noise. Therefore, I’ve always regarded the ANC on the Sony MDR-1000X as the ‘best’. While I haven’t taken the AirPods Max on a plane yet, I can say that it deadens ambient noises like dogs barking, vacuums, and TVs that are left on in the background.Mesh Headband: I love the look of the headband. I think it looks very clean and it accentuates the lines of the AirPods Max. The design is right up my alley.Weight: I’ve heard some people say that the weight of the headphones is an issue for them. I have noticed that they feel a bit heavier than other headphones I’ve used, but the weight seems evenly distributed to me and so it doesn’t bother me. I’ve worn the headphones for several hours at a time and have not had any issues with headaches or soreness.Buttons: I am a big fan of the buttons. This is odd for me to say since I never thought I would be a proponent of moving to analog from digital, but Apple did a nice job of blending in the Digital Crown and the ANC button.Smart Case: This is one thing I would have reconsidered if I were designing the AirPods Max — the Smart Case. I really consider it more of a ‘sleeve’ than a case because — well, that’s what it is. The sleeve is made with a single piece of what seems to be polyurethane material and utilizes magnets for the closure. While the sleeve does protect the metal earpieces of the headphones from getting scratched up, for the most part, it doesn’t protect the headband and there is even a cut out on the bottom that leaves the headphones exposed to the elements and potential damage. I also noticed that when I take the headphones out of the sleeve that the AirPods clink together. The only way I’ve been able to stop that from happening is if I physically place my hand there.Even though there might be a few minor things I would like to see improved about the AirPods Max, I’m absolutely thrilled with them. They are far superior to any other listening experience I’ve had and think that their price tag is worth the investment. Even though the cost is prohibitive for many, if you want the ultimate listening experience, I can’t recommend the AirPods Max enough.","Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2021",AFOC5DDP4AVYACNA6OHAZZVCY76Q,True,191,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R36SKB26883QRH,5.0 out of 5 stars WOW. Especially if you get them at $449 $100 off Apple Store. **edited to add info Logic Pro Ipad**,John k,5,"I have Sennheiser headphones since the 80s. I have studio type corded and bought 2 of the consumer Bluetooth models for $99 each HD405T and I not saying they are expected to be on the same level as these but holy toledo Apple wins here. Most I’ve spent was $300 for a corded model so for me to jump up to $450 was a stretch of faith. Another reviewer stated she was hearing impaired and these were game changers. Her review sold me. I’m here to sell anyone else that is hearing impaired and has the coin and an IPhone to pair with it. 1. The noise cancelling is better than 35 DB of safety earmuffs I wear for loud noises. Don’t get me wrong about earmuffs. True ear muffs don’t let sound in and also for say shooting a bullet, the pressure wave it creates. Loud riveting is 120db without the pressure wave so it subtly wrecks your hearing over time. 2. It pairs with iphone and iPad simultaneously and when doing so won’t cause either to drop out or any other noises. 3. Comfortable all day 12 hours or more comfortable. The cheaper bluetooths I used have vinyl earmuffs so sweat breaks down the threads and I’m replacing the ear pads every 3-6 month. These Pro max ones are real nice. Apple foam quality. 4. Charges really fast, was at 50% and plugged in and in 20 mins was at 95%. 5. Lightning charger on these now 2020 models . 6 loved them so much that after using a these black ones at work, bought a blue pair for home. If Apple makes hearing aides that are true medical devices I’d say they would crush and own the market. These are that good with their technology. I’m adding that after about a month of using them I finally got around to playing with Logic Pro for IPad. These headphones have a noise cancelling feature that is unmatched. I was blown away with how they actually worked with replacing my IPAD microphone to block out the noise of my gas furnace ( i was arms length away and the burner and fan kicked on) and I recorded a voice track started it with noise cancelling off and was just speaking. Turned the noise cancelling on mid track while speaking and the fan and motor noise nearly disappeared. I don’t know enough of editing to reduce it to nothing but WOW. That’s amazing. I guess I might have to actually read the instructions on answering my phone with them on and seeing how well my voice transmits to others, I never use the headphones to take calls as I want the voice in my one good ear so I grab my phone and switch to it to answer a call. So yeah the noise cancelling is pro level quality IMHO.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AHLBV5WKZOKRWJA7QHHD5TAXMCQQ,True,25,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R13KM4B0OFZMUG,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds great! Heavier than expected.,William Ocasio,4,"Yeah, I think they sound great! They have really good noise cancellation and spatial audio functions. The battery last pretty long and they charge up pretty fast. My only issue is how heavy they are. They tend to cause fatigue after awhile. They’re also bulky and don’t sit right on my head. I feel like I’m constantly fidgeting with them to get them to feel comfortable. Its not the worst but I think they could lighter and fit your head better. Overall, I’d say great quality in sound and durability. They also work really well when talking on a call or FaceTime. They also sync effortlessly with all of my Apple devices which is nice.

R2TJFPS6B6MLM5,5.0 out of 5 stars I love these.,Ecstatic Major,5,"My problem with the typical air pods are they fall easily out of my ears with basics motion. Maybe my ears are to big? It took four years of constant use for the annoying on side becomes lower in volume or just doesn’t connect or work at all. Not to mention The aesthetics after you drop them in the street by mistake. I’m happy about the longevity tho. The air pod pros much of the same story. If you have a pair I’m sure you have a “how much ear wax will it take to effect sound story/frustration”. Regardless Constantly playing music on the highest volume for three straight years and they are just now Malfunctioning. I spend a little over $1000 total when it comes to the purchase of those AirPods. Much like most when I saw the AirPod max I became curious lol. So I bought one and I’m gonna be 100% honest.I love them 😍They are weightless, they are comfortable. I’ve even forgotten about them a few times while listening to a podcast. I remember a person saying they feel like heavy metal and come off as stiff. Case in point try things yourself don’t go off of everyone’s opinion. The sound quality is actually good. For me tho while driving, I called a buddy of mine to talk on them and he said that i sound crystal clear.I remember reading something somewhere where a guy said these sucked for Various reasons, especially that if you don’t have them in their case, they will constantly connect to your phone. That is a valid point, yet that feature can be Altered by way of the settings.In closing. If you want studio quality head phones that sound great. This is an Excellent pic now obviously these are extremely expensive and may be overpriced, but this is what we Come To expect from Apple products. If you have owned AirPods in the past, if you have majority Apple products, regardless of what negative feedback anybody is saying about this product you will enjoy it because I know I am as a matter fact I’m going to another one. Just so I can have one and one separate one that I deal with at the house.

RFVR139DQBNRF,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose Noise Canceling 700 vs AirPods Max vs Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra,David W.,5,"UPDATE OCT 2023: Here is my original review which still holds true now that I have owned the Bose NC 700 for a couple of years. Last week, I bought the new Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra over-ear headphones. I added that review and comparison at the bottom.————————Original review……For the past ten years I have enjoyed and been dependent upon noise canceling headphones. With that has come a journey into the audiophile community with others who are on a quest for high-fidelity sound. My journey led me to many headphones that sound absolutely pristine but none with noise canceling and few are wireless. Until late, the Bose Noise Canceling 700 are my compromise for great sound and noise canceling in a wireless headphone. So, when Apple announced the AirPods Max, I had to try them to know how they compare to my Bose 700. Here are my conclusions so far...STYLEThe fit and finish on the AirPods Max is absolutely beautiful! Love it much more than the Bose. I just like the way they look and feel. Before I purchased the AirPods I probably watched 50 unboxing and review videos. So, I thought I had a good idea of how they looked. They are nicer in person. Sleek, premium, modern and minimalistic.COMFORTComfort is about the same! AirPods Max are definitely heavier but do not necessarily feel much heavier on he head as the weight is balanced well. I have larger ears and the ear cups on the Bose 700 go a little deeper to make room for my ears. So, over several hours, the Bose do feel slightly more comfortable. The Bose also do not get as warm as the Apple.TRANSPARENCY MODETransparency mode, in my opinion, is actually more natural on the Bose. The Apple headphones actually amplify the sound around you a few decibles too much. In other words, things sound louder than they actually are with the transparency mode on the AirPods Max. Also, the Bose reproduces your own voice much more naturally when in transparency mode.SOUND QUALITYSound quality at certain volume levels is almost exactly the same. Kind of unbelievable. It is as though Apple reverse engineered the Bose 700 and copied its sound signature and noice canceling to within 5 percent. There is a definite sound quality difference though that changes with the volume level. This is all about the DSP. Of course, the digital signal processing (DSP) is called Computational Audio on the Max and Volume Optimized EQ on the Bose. This is what works differently and what accounts for sound differences dependent on the volume. Basically, the Bose sound better at 60 percent volume and below. Bose just has it dialed in so that everything sounds rich and balanced. I usually listen to music at about 55 percent volume on my iPad. So, I prefer the sound of the Bose. The sound at 60 percent and below on the AirPods Max suffers from a veiled upper midrange. An alto saxophone, for example, will sound as though it is being played behind a wooden door.Now between 60 and 70 percent volume is where both headphones sound virtually the same. It is uncanny! Both sound absolutely wonderful. Probably the best you will ever hear on wireless noise canceling headphones (yes, the Sony has an amplified and unnatural mid-bass making them sound deep but not high fidelity).At 70 percent volume and above the Bose DSP begins to lower the bass response to avoid distortion. The bass gets progressively quieter as you increase on the Bose to where there is virtually no bass at about 90 percent volume. The AirPods Max, on the other hand, handle bass very nicely from 70 all the way up to 100 percent. In fact, they sound perfectly balanced all the way from 60 to 100 percent volume with no sound quality degradation. If there is a fault it is that the bass loses a little nuance. In other words at high volumes the bass is a little over controlled. The softer vibrations like on the trail of a bass string get lost a little.So to summarize the sound comparisons. The two headphones sound equal from 60 to 70 percent volume. The Bose sound bette at 60 percent volume and below. Finally, the AirPods sound better (by quite a bit, it’s not even close) at 70 percent volume and above.CONTROLSThe final comparison are the controls. Apple wins in my book. The Digital Crown has a perfect feel to it. It rotates very smoothly with a perfect amount of resistance. It presses well also. Apple has hyper dialed-in these controls. It makes me never want to have to use the touch-pad on the Bose 700 ever again.WHICH ONE IS FOR ME?Everything is comparable on these two headphones, but in the end, sound quality at my preferred listening level wins out. Since I listen to at about 50 percent volume, the Bose continue to be he choice for me. I just have a fixed routine for when I use noise canceling headphones.Now, I am sure that Apple could probably update their firmware to adjust the computational audio in order to fix the balance issues below 60 percent volume. If they did, then the fit and finish and controls might win me back over to the AirPods Max. But, the slight compromise in long-term comfort would cause me to hesitate a little.ONE LAST THINGOne last thing, the spatial audio is pretty Amazing. If I had to watch movies on my iPad these headphones would be a must. The surround sound effects are as good (slightly better) than my Bose home theatre system. The overall sound quality for movies is slightly less (more sterile and hollow sounding, probably because of the limited Bluetooth codec) than my Bose home theatre system.—————————-BOSE QUIET COMFORT ULTRA VS BOSE NC 700 (and AirPods Max)Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra HeadphonesSeveral years ago, I discovered Bose Quiet Comfort headphones. My first pair wore the QC15 and I have owned every iteration since then. Until now, the best of the best have been the Bose NC700 which are spectacular headphones. Now, I find myself the proud owner of the company’s newest over-ear headset, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra. After thorough comparison, I can confidently say that the new Ultra are an upgrade in every way. There is especially one aspect which causes the Ultra to make them an absolutely must-have for music lovers. I will get to that in a moment, but first here are my thoughts on how the NC700 and QC Ultra compare:COMFORTI am very happy to report that the Bose QC Ultra are more comfortable than the NC 700 headphones. They are lighter, there is less clamping force and the headband distributes weight better on the top of your head. I used to consider the NC 700 headphones as the second most comfortable pair of over-ear headphones second only to the QC45. Well, the Ultra now take this 2nd place spot and they are almost as comfortable as the 45. Very Great!NOISE CANCELINGYes, Bose has also improved the noise canceling. When in quiet mode the headphones put you in a place where the world simply disappears. Each iteration of Bose headphones through the years has improved upon the previous in this area. The Ultra are no different. In fact, when I was testing them out my wife was standing 3 feet from me and trying to talk to me. I never even knew she was talking. This has never happened with my older NC 700.SOUND QUALITYThe QC Ultra are more of a spiritual successor to the NC700 than they are the QC45. The sound is much more similar to the NC700. What they retain is the excellent clarity and instrument separation. The mids are just as perfectly present. Also the highs have a very pleasing ring without ever sounding harsh. What was great on the 700 but even better on the Ultra is the bass. Bose says that the new Ultra are now taking samples of sound inside the ear ups and then actively adjusts the bass to sound best dependent on the shape of ears, the seal of the pads, etc. This really does make a difference. I wear glass which compromises the acoustic seal. The Ultra compensates for this and makes the bass sound deeper and have a greater punch than my NC700. So, the sound signature overall is better and gets WAY better with immersive audio. But, we are getting to that.IMMERSIVE AUDIOThis is the feature! If you are a music lover then this is the feature which gives the biggest incentive to upgrade from the NC 700. Music with immersive audio just sounds better. I have several setups of actual stereo bookshelf speakers around my house. I always preferred a good pair of music monitors over headphones. Why? Because you can hear and imagine the soundstage in front of you. Good recordings place an orchestra or band members several feet from each-other as you listen. With live listening you can hear the music spread throughout the venue and this is what immersive audio on the Quiet Comfort Headphones does. It places the band a couple feet in front of you. It feels like you can point to and reach out and touch the various vocalist and instruments. It is so great! It is exactly like advertised. Immersive audio makes it sound like you are listening to a good pair of speakers in a room acoustically ideal for premium audio. Now that I have heard it, I can never go back to regular headphones.CONCLUSIONThere is so much more good that I could say about the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones. The buttons are well placed and are useful - even the touch-sensitive volume slider works well enough! The app also just works and all the needed settings are there to easily adjust. The carrying case looks premium and is compact. It is smaller than the NC700 case and even more compact than the QC45’s storage option. There are some things I do not like about the headphones. For example, immersive audio for movies is still not as good or immersive as Spacial Audio on Apple’s AirPods Max when watching Dolby content. Also, the placement and function of the buttons is different than what I am used to on the 700. In the end though, I am ecstatic with what Bose has done in their newest iteration of Bose over-the-ear noise canceling headphones. My NC 700 are going on eBay and I look forward to many great years with the Ultra. Well done Bose!","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2021",AHDMXI6TQQPBM46JCYRNHJPUAG6A,True,776,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R38GOXYR25A6Q8,5.0 out of 5 stars High Quality Headphones!,FreeSmoke,5,"I was really hoping a 2nd generation would have released by now but decided to get them and will buy the new generation once it releases. Everything about the headset is great. The build, sound and comfort quality is top tier. I returned the Sony XM5 after comparing the sound and comfort. The XM5s were lighter but more uncomfortable due to the ear pads and headbands which made them not wearable after only 10 minutes. The bass is very muffled on the XM5s as well. The AirPod Max don't have any issues besides maybe if they could stop music when taking them off also increasing battery life along with some other enhancements such as improving the microphone and switching to USB-C.

RXAPC9C5FJLFU,"4.0 out of 5 stars As a complete package, well worth $550 - UPDATE",Garp,4,"These are my favorite headphones. When you account for the sound quality, noise cancellation, convenience, comfort and the quality of the build, it makes the price more palatable.That said, there's no denying that they are expensive. At the same time, they pretty much reside in their own category of headphones. You can easily get better sounding headphones for less than $200 - but those are wired and lack active noise cancelling. You can shop around other Bluetooth headphones with ANC (XM4, QCII35, 700 etc…) but those don't sound as good. Though they certainly don't sound bad and they're a couple of Benjamins cheaper. I firmly believe the Max's ANC is also better than all the previously mentioned gear, though not by much when compared to the XM4s. One very nice thing about the AirPods Max is the ANC causes no hiss at all, not even a little.But there's just no comparison when you compare the build and comfort. Other Bluetooth ANC headphones feel cheap. Once you handle the faux leather and creaky plastic parts you understand why they're much less expensive. The cloth and foam ear pads on the Max are nearly perfect. They form a good seal, even with glasses, and they’re comfortable for long listening sessions. The aluminum and stainless steel parts feel both durable and even luxurious. The mesh headband distributes the Max's substantial weight very evenly. Moreover, everything is modular and repairable on the Max. The circuit boards, batteries, cups, pads, the headband itself - all disassemble with relative ease so your purchase may just last for decades.Much has been made of the Max’s weight. In my experience, it’s a non issue. Lounging in the house, washing dishes, sitting at the computer - the weight is fine. BUT, the clamping force is another matter. These things firmly squeeze your head. Initially, I thought I was going to have to return them. Having used them for a couple weeks, they’ve loosened significantly. Possibly, I’ve also acclimated to them.Transparency mode is amazing. Without doubt, it’s the best implementation I’ve heard. I’ve yet to try out Spacial Audio because until it works with my TV, it’s a gimmick that I don’t care about. I don’t watch movies on my iPhone or even iPad. If you do, you may feel differently.I do wish I could use them to block out sounds without playing music or white noise. But when not playing audio, the ANC causes too much pressure on my eardrums.I also wish there were an accompanying App that enabled more intuitive EQ or control of other settings: like perhaps degrees of ANC or better monitoring of battery life and standby. This seems like an oversight on Apple’s part.Yes, the case isn’t much of a case and it is annoying that they don’t include a cable for wired listening. But those are small things and do not detract from the sound quality, convenience and materials of the headphones themselves.The ear pads do make my ears warm in my usage. I don’t see how any closed back headphone with a decent seal wouldn’t make one’s ears warm. That said, the warmth doesn’t bother me at all and I don’t feel that they’re uncomfortably hot.Recently, there have been many reports of condensation and/or sweat accumulating beneath the ear pads on the plastic housing that protects the drivers. Though I don’t doubt these accounts, I have yet to have it happen. After using the AirPods Max for three to four hours, at my desk and around the house, they’re as dry as can be. I don’t know what combination of temperature, humidity, body heat and time causes moisture to appear. All I can suggest is that if you purchase the AirPods Max, try and reproduce the issue with your normal usage. Hopefully, it will be a non issue for you as well.If you own a couple of Apple devices, say a Mac and an iPhone, the Max’s convenience makes them even more compelling. Normal Bluetooth pairing can be mildly annoying or, depending on your devices, VERY frustrating. There’s no such hassle with the AirPods Max. They just connect. They just switch. They just work.If you’re cross shopping, there are a couple of Bluetooth headphones that might sound slightly better, but they lack ANC. There are many, many headphones that are both cheaper and sound better, but they are wired and lack ANC. The AirPods Max really are in a different class compared to the $350 range of Bluetooth ANC headphones the market has become used to.In my opinion, these should not be compared with lesser ANC BT headphones but with the BO H95s. Though I've never owned the H95s, I have held, listened to and envied them. They’re amazing. But they’re also $800 and the ANC is not as advanced. In comparison, the AirPods Max are a bargain, even if they don’t sound quite as nice as the H95s - though they are very close.I’m very pleased with the AirPods Max. As a complete package, I’m not aware of any other headphones, at any price, that are competitive.*UPDATE*This morning I shoveled snow for a little over an hour while wearing the AirPods Max. Admittedly, my understanding of atmospheric physics is pretty low, but I figured my very warm head combined with freezing temperatures affecting the aluminum would likely induce some condensation. But, after shoveling, they were as dry as can be. Again, I'm not casting doubt on the many reports of moisture below the ear pads, but I can't reproduce the effect.","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2021",AGUHW5GYDW3CLR4UP5GNJ5Q3VTXQ,True,123,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
RTE78IRVVM088,3.0 out of 5 stars HAD HIGH HOPES BUT GOT THE HIGH HAT!,Brother Tao,3,"Well, I was having difficulty deciding after spending hours each of several days doing research. Most reviewers chose the Sony XM4 because of its much lower price, less weight and proven comfort and reliability. Of course that wasn’t good enough for me because I thought I was a little more audoholic than many so I needed to make a more insightful discovery. I had a Sennheiser several decades ago that was nothing more than a small piece of foam over a small driver and wired of course. It sounded awesome believe it or not so I moved on over to the Sennheiser Momentum 300 which most reviewers rated at or near the top in sound quality and build. It was marked down for modest noise reduction capability and a weight of 300 grams lying in between the Sony at 245 grams and the APMax at 385. Sony is plastic, Apple is metal and fiber and the Momentum is metal and real leather on the ear pads and headband. Apple Earphones are new age sexy, Sennheiser Momentum 300 are retro cool and Sony let’s call modern but plain. Price wise Sony is no higher than $348, Sennheiser is available for $330 down from $400 at introduction in 2019 or so and Apple is $550.Apple does Apple and I have discovered first hand how brutal they are about forcing you to do what they want. If you try to do anything other than pair them with your iPhone or iPad you will meet roadblocks. They only offer music at 48 kilobits per second so that is all they allow you to listen to in their headphones. If you try to hook up to a device with a higher bit rate it will be reduced before it passes through to your headphones. You can theoretically pay $35 for a special little wire that allows you to connect to a device that would otherwise allow you to plug into a receiver. You can only get it from Apple and even then the 3.5 mmonnection won’t fit into receivers because they take a larger jack which is 6.35. So while they sell adapters that will fit the bill they aren’t Apple approved. In short they don’t just want you to buy and use all their equipment. They force you to use their other products to use the headphones successfully. The weight of the Air Pods Max coupled with what they call clamping force makes them very uncomfortable to wear and don’t even think about exercising or running in them. They will bounce around as you move and I began to feel strain and stress from the fit within ten minutes. Sure, I bought them to entertain myself on long walks but I don’t know where I would put them for the walk home when they are too heavy to wear. You cannot hang them around your neck without choking yourself and then there is the bra/purse like carrier if you was to carry that. Won’t fold in on itself like many of most headphones.No matter how sexy it looks or how cool it makes you feel to be envied for your coolness the grimace on your face after an hour with these on your head will not attract anyone. I really wanted these as I was telling myself they must have the best sound quality and that is what I am all about. Still if I don’t like wearing them the music doesn’t help much and I am left with hoping a really cool person or persons will see that I am cool also. I don’t hate Apple and I have an IPhone 10max and an iPad(I bought my first one in April 2010 when the first one was introduced and was the very first truly friendly computer like device) and a MacBook Pro which I won’t replace.With these headphones they have gone too far with the silly and unnecessary allegiance to Apple required to use it easily. You can search for hours online to find workarounds but half or more of what people suggest doesn’t work. Meanwhile Apple knows all of this and basically gives us the old high hat if we are willing to buy products that compel us to buy only their other products to make them work. Connecting instantly to my iPhone when picked up or put on rather than having to use a typical Bluetooth prompt to accept a connection is not worth enslaving myself just to show aluminum on my ears. I am boxing these up even though they arrived earlier today. I bought them from Amazon because of their stellar return policy and I recommend you do the same if you want to try these. If I kept them I would be doing what many who read my review will do and that is defend and rationalize my choice. That is what human beings do. So if Apple product allegiances are important to you after spending this amount of money on top of all the other products you have bought from them feel free to put it on blast. I know this is a lot of money to spend for many if not most people and I wanted to write something for folks who haven’t had time to do a lot of research and are at a decision point.I am torn between the Sony XM4(leaving me light headed and looking average) and the Sennheiser Momentum 300(xciting to listen to but making me look my retro like my age). If you want to check out online reviews you will find that deciding who to listen to and trust is every bit as difficult as making your headphone choice. I don’t know who receives what in the way of free products to use or resell or even monetary compensation which might disappear with too much honesty. All I can do is tell you what I think and let you take it into consideration if helpful.I don’t care about corporations especially large ones as they take care of themselves just fine. I have learnedthat there are people who are loyal to and defend corporations and don’t like others criticizing them or their products. In my own life I find that my weakest point is often my best point pushed too far. I think the exuberance for these Air Max headphones and Apples marketing games has likely reached that place with these headphones. Who knows? Maybe I will update my review once I try the Sony or the Sennheiser or both. For now I will be happy to merely take a heavy load off my head!","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2021",AH73LXZ4GRRM5OQM2HLZZ6MDSFUQ,True,239,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

RCK58668L62Z4,1.0 out of 5 stars Water/Condensation buildup after 3-4 hours,M. Cordoba,1,"Summary: TLDR;Love the sound, great comfort on top of head (but a little tight on the side of the head around the ears), awesome for movies (spatial audio is awesome) and music. Excellent ANC. Connection from phone to iPad and back is perfect. However there is water buildup after 3-4 hours underneath the earcups - repeatable when just sitting at my desk at 66-70 degrees. Connection to a MacBook Pro and back to phone is just not as seamless, and it gets lost sometimes. I returned them but tested them extensively for 3 weeks, really wanted to keep them but the water flaw is too concerning at this price to risk it.Detailed Review:I’m going to start with the good:- spatial audio is really good. Watching the Mandelorian is great - more for the surround sound experience than the more gimmicky thing with turning your head - which is “cool” but adds little to no value. Whereas surround sound - experiencing noises from different sides really helps with the immersion.- sound quality is excellent for Bluetooth headphones. I preferred these instead of the XM4. I am not an audiophile but I like good sound and these seemed more balanced. I have $200 wired seinheiser headphones that I might like a tiny bit better for music for what it’s worth.- construction build quality is definitely a step up from competitors.- connecting to iOS devices is excellent and to a MacBook Pro is good - but not great. More on that later.- ANC really good equal pretty much to XM4. I think xm4 is slightly better at some things and these are better cancelling other noises. Overall excellent- headband / top of head very comfortable. Much more so than the xm4.Neutral:- lots of people made a big deal about no power off button and talk about it just “draining battery” unless you put it in the case. I tested this a lot, and it seems Apple is accurate when they say it goes to low power mode after 5 minutes of inactivity. Losing about 1% every couple of hours. Essentially losing 5% when left without a case overnight. I’m talking 5-6pm to 8am. However I had an issue where they wouldn’t turn on (only 1 day) with a full battery. Since there is no power button... I removed them form my ears out then back on, I stuffed them in the “smart case” removed them, nothing. I plugged them to the lightning cable to see if the charge light would turn on, and then they immediately started working (battery read 109%, I only plugged them in for 5 seconds). It only happened one day out of 20... but annoying nonetheless.- ear pad material is soft but course so moving it side to side hurts my ears. But leaving then on (normal use case) is comfortable.Cons:- the “case”. It has a nice material but it doesn’t provide any protection for them at all. Fairly pointless and you can see all the jokes online about it. I don’t think it looks bad, it’s just pointless without any protection. Going to ultra low power mode a day sooner (it still takes like 15 hours or something, not sure why it’s not instant to that power mode).- the price. Just a tad too high to swallow, but I had returned the XM4 for various small annoyances to splurged on this hoping it solved the issues - it mostly does but the last 2 points made me return them:- connecting to MacBook Pro and iPhone “automatic switching”. I was hoping this would be better than the XM4 (which constantly got stuck on the wrong device and had no way other than turning off Bluetooth to send it back to the laptop). It is better, but it’s not perfect. It’s perfect between iOS devices - going back and forth from phone to iPad is seamless and pretty amazing - much better than anything out there. However once a MacBook is involved it’s a different deal. There is a little prompt at the top right that shows up that you need to click when switching back and forth, but it no always shows up. Sometimes it does, sometimes it switches automatically and sometimes I need to connect the headphones to the MacBook again. I’m still not sure when it does which of them. However removing them from my ears and putting them back on resets it and I’m connected to the MacBook or the prompt shows up for me to click. Overall I’m not sure why they couldn’t make it as seamless as iOS where just clicking pause on one and play on them other switches the connection immediately: there is no awkward prompt or anything. Overall I was disappointed on the instant switching when involving my MacBook Pro. Still works better than the xm4 and Bose 700 that sometimes gets lost in between with no easy reset.Finally why I returned them - you can see the pictures I attached. I wanted these as primary work headphones (conference calls - which they work great, ANC which works great, easy switching which works very good but not great, and for music and movies which they are excellent).However the stories online I thought maybe affected few people. The first day I didn’t have any buildup, nor the second or the third. However today after a 4 hour session, I checked and there was enough for me to not be comfortable that these expensive headphones would last the 10 years I was hoping they would.If it weren’t for the water buildup I would probably keep them, they are that good, but this is a deal breaker since Apple does not cover water damage as part of warranty.I was simply sitting in my desk, half basement. I didn’t walk or exercise or anything. Temperature was 66 degrees Fahrenheit so fairly cool. The theory online is the metal acts as a heat sink in comparison to the warmth between your ears and earcup area.Update: I have been able to consistently (daily) repressive the condensation issue. It was not a one time thing. After 3-4 hours every day I get to wipe the inside because there is water. Yeah I returned them.Anyway I’m not gonna risk holding an expensive paperweight. Too bad because they are great headphones with a fatal flaw.I contacted Apple and the just said: “we are aware of the claims and are looking into them”. They are not just claims they are very much real. And you don’t have to wear them for 20 hours - this was only 4 hours.If you have a question feel free to ask. I’ve tested these and the xm4s fairly extensively.","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2021",AEL44WHEDEFNR3LR65SSDZWB4G3Q,True,371,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

Very comfortable, long lasting battery, even after a year. After every use I take the earcups off to wipe the water but it’s not enough to damage the wiring inside. I usually wear it 4 hours at a time and regularly dry the inside so no damage would occur. The $549 price point not worth it and I do recommend getting this when it’s around $479 or $450 cheapest, which is $500 - 520 after taxes.

R1QWZ44X4BL71V,4.0 out of 5 stars A Balanced Audio Experience,Juan da Silva,4,"I recently got my hands on the Apple AirPods Max, and I must say, they didn't disappoint. The headphones arrived promptly at my doorstep, securely sealed as expected. The initial unboxing experience was nothing short of satisfying, and I was eager to dive into the audio quality.Speaking of sound, the AirPods Max offer a solid audio experience. The audio is clear, and the bass is punchy, delivering an enjoyable listening experience. However, I did find myself wanting more in terms of customization. Apple's limited equalization options leave a bit to be desired, as I longed for the ability to fine-tune the sound to match my preferences.One noteworthy aspect that slightly underwhelmed me was the exclusive wireless nature of the headphones. While they provide convenience, it becomes apparent that their true potential shines when paired with high-fidelity audio sources. Listening to music with the AirPods Max is a delight, but the wireless limitation can prevent you from fully appreciating the depth of sound they are capable of delivering.To make the most of the remarkable sound quality, it's evident that Apple intends for you to immerse yourself in the Apple ecosystem, particularly through their Apple Music service. While other platforms like Spotify and YouTube Music offer good sound, the complete enveloping experience is best achieved when paired with Apple Music.In terms of build and design, the AirPods Max exhibit a touch of luxury with their sleek aesthetics. They do carry a tad more weight compared to their leading competitors, but personally, I didn't find it bothersome. However, it's important to note that these headphones are not designed for gym use. The lack of waterproofing and the tendency of the ear cushions to trap heat make them less suitable for intense physical activities.When it comes to noise cancellation, the AirPods Max do a commendable job. While they might not be the absolute best in the market, they effectively filter out a significant portion of external noise, allowing you to enjoy your music without excessive distractions.In my conclusion, the Apple AirPods Max provide a well-rounded audio experience that caters to music enthusiasts seeking premium sound quality. While there are some minor drawbacks, such as limited equalization options and the exclusivity of their audio potential, these headphones are a solid choice for those within the Apple ecosystem who prioritize exceptional sound and design.","Reviewed in the United States August 9, 2023",AGKCGXOXKWXJBEGTLDCWSS7BFO4A,True,32,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R2XOPTO11FPGXE,3.0 out of 5 stars 550 Dollar 3-Star Review,Adam Martin,3,"One week with the AirPods Max and there’s good and there’s bad.You really want these headphones for business/casual use. The technology really flows seamlessly with your other Apple products. It’s sleek looking and the sound, while it’s not the loudest or the most hard hitting, the sound was alright! (NOT AMAZING)Now to go to the bad… Notice I said it’s good for casual use! These headphones are not meant for the Gym (ironically this is the number one place I see them lol) using these for the gym is a mess. They slip off of your head with any little motion, and the worst part is the Earphone Fluffs (which are removable) they build up sweat inside the actual ear hole to the point where the sweat will stay there for DAYS.The Removable Ear Foams are way too easy to fall out, when these headphones slip off of your head, except an explosion of earphones to go flying off of the headset.Overall, was it worth 600 dollars all together with shipping and taxes? No. You can get a PS5, put a deposit down for 2 Cybertrucks or pay a quarter of your rent before you get these headphones.Maybe if they were 200 dollars, this would be a 4-Star Review…","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2024",AFX3FZLEPOIKQLT4GA3EDM67GTGQ,True,1,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

R2KQIWCHGSMRK9,3.0 out of 5 stars Major Issue With Multipoint Connection,DBM,3,"I really loved these headphones. The sound quality and noise cancellation were terrific for me. I also love the convenience of the digital crown. Although most complain about the case, I LOVE it. It's like a cute little purse! There is one issue that made me return this product. The multipoint connection seemed to be for Apple products only.For example, my headphones switched seamlessly from my iPhone to my iPad. However, when I connected my Samsung TV to the headphones, I could hear the TV through them, but I had to reconnect the headphones to my iPhone or iPad after doing so. So, while watching the TV or playing a game, I am not getting any phone calls or text notifications through the headphones because they have disconnected for me to play the TV. I also cannot accept any calls while watching the TV. I have to go back into my iPhone's Bluetooth devices and reconnect the headphones to the iPhone in order to have a conversation through the headphones. This is not a true multipoint connection. The headphones would have been perfect if Apple had not had this error.I ended up going with a pair of Bose QC Ultras out of necessity. These headphones allow me to watch the TV/game through the headphones, and when someone calls me, it quiets the TV and announces the call. This is a true multipoint connection because all points stay connected and interact with each other. I also own much cheaper Skullcandy Crushers and Evos, which have a true multipoint connection.This issue may not be a deal breaker for most, but it was for me. After saving for these headphones for nearly eight months, I was past excited to buy them. The simple joy of unboxing an Apple product is worth its weight in gold. When I realized that these costly headphones did not have a true multipoint connection aside from their Apple branded products, I wanted to slap my own face with a powdered hand!

R5OE63AHWCBDJ,4.0 out of 5 stars Expensive But Excellent ANC Headphones,USAUSA,4,"I will be comparing the APM with the Sony XM4's as I purchased and used both side-by-side.The APM have incredible active noise cancellation (tested with airplane white noise on YouTube) and their transparency mode is incredible. I give them the edge on both fronts compared to the Sony's. I also think the handoff between multiple Apple devices is superior to the Sony's which can only pair to two devices at the same time. I also feel there is potential in the magnet APM cups that can be changed as desired. If you don't like the ones that come with the APM you could potentially purchase a 3rd party option of a different material.I prefer the Sony's for sound quality. You can tweak the EQ to your liking with their app. With the APM you are stuck with their default sound signature or the terrible presets in iOS settings. The default APM sound is good but leaves a lot to be desired compared to the Sony's which literally lets you tweak it to how your ears desire. I am a bass-head and the APM bass simply lacking for rap and pop music (to my ears).While I think the concept of the APM physical controls for volume and track selection is superior to Sony's touch controls for the same, the placement of these buttons on the top of the right cup is baffling. I'm confident most people are like myself and like to adjust their headphones by gripping the top and bottom of their respective ear cups. By doing so you will inevitably press on these buttons. The Sony's have two buttons located on the bottom side edge (on/off and a custom button that by defaults lets you toggle modes). Far better placement.The 'smart case' is actually nothing but a sleeve that is rather ridiculous as it's required to properly turn off the headphones entirely. Why Apple opted for no on/off button is beyond me. The APM come with no cable to connect to airplane entertainment systems, no travel case, no ability to fold into a more compact size, and no charging brick. A $550 set of headphones should include a charging brick and nice travel case, don't you think??The Sony's meanwhile have all the cables you could possibly need, fold into a compact size, and comes with a lovely hardshell case. It doesn't have a charging brick but it's also far less expensive compared to the APM.Ah yes, price. At retail the APM are $550 and while the Sony's retail for $350, they can often be found brand new for $280, literally half the price.So let's recap. APM have amazing ANC, transparency mode, mic for phone calls, the ability to swap out the ear cups, and flawlessly work with multiple Apple products.The Sony's allow you to tweak the sound to your liking, are more comfortable by far to wear, an on/off button plus superior button placement, a hardshell case, fold into a compact size, include the necessary cables for travel, and cost half as much as the APM.","Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2021",AE27F7PUICDDBNNMIMMXWXWS7LKA,True,2,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

I ended up buying these because I work from home a few days out of the week and my AirPods battery life couldn’t last the whole work day.The sound quality is crisp and clean. The battery life is great and the ease of using within an iPhone is great. They are totally comfortable and not heavy at all. However, I will say - I use these sitting at my desk - if you were going to buy these while moving around I wouldn’t really recommend because they could fall off pretty easily.Lastly, yes like other reviewers said - I would have preferred a deeper bass. If you turn up the volume really loud (and these get LOUD) then you can really hear the bass. But at normal listening levels I would have preferred some extra bass. It’s still good - but I just like a deep bass sound.Anyways, I would highly recommend these headphones despite their steep price.","Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2024",AGVVECD5RULZWBCTRBVCDN43KC6Q,True,20,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R29MHP1BULERM4,5.0 out of 5 stars A must for iPhone and AppleTV,photog56,5,"I am going to forego the normal discussion regarding how much they cost and if it is worth it. That's seems to be strictly individual to me. They are expensive and I will leave it at that. I also own the Sony XM4's, which will I compare them to.Comfort. These are heavy headphones and definitely taking some getting used to. In addition, if you have a large head, as do I, the clamping force on your head may be a dealbreaker for you. I have learned to adjust the position on my head to mitigate that. Unlike many headphones, you will spend a little more time adjusting them for comfort. The Sony XM4s are definitely more comfortable.Controls. The two button controls are simple and easy to use which is the same setup on the Apple watch. I prefer this setup to the touch controls on the XM4, which can be hit and miss. You can adjust the direction for volume up or down based on what is more intuitive to you.Sound. The sound is absolutely amazing. Hands down the best I have ever heard. While listening to music is often discussed, not much is said about using them with AppleTV which is actually the primary reason I purchased them. Listening to a movie or TV show through the Airpods Max is simply unbelievable. Spatial audio is a brilliant audio enhancement.Battery life. I have been able to get the 21 hours they advertise. Battery life is not nearly as robust as the XM4s however. Much has been made about the fact that they can't be turned off. I have not found that to be an issue, although it does force you to put them in the case in order to put them in sleep mode. Noice cancellation is excellent.Miscellaneous. Yes, the case is ridiculous. I purchased a more viable case for. It does not come with a charging adapter (brick). That was a not a real issue for me. I was far more upset when they shipped iPhone 12s without them. I find them too heavy to for exercising. I use the XM4s for that. I do not use them for business meeting calls (Zoom, etc.), so I have no opinion on that. If you are going to purchase AppleCare, purchase it through Amazon. Adding it with Apple is a hassle if you purchased them from Amazon.Summary. The construction of the Airpods Max is something to behold. If you are an iPhone, Apple Music, AppleTV user, you will definitely want to consider these. I was on the fence for awhile because of the price, but after using them I have no regrets. I give them 4.5 stars. The weight prevents me from giving it 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2021",AHRQAPTG6O6KU43PKLWWYRPGB5DQ,True,7,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

R2MZOQ6E0V6IPK,2.0 out of 5 stars They're good but for $550 they need to be INCREDIBLE.,Lalo97,2,"I decided to spoil myself and try these out. Reviewers say they're excellent and have the best ANC/transparency mode out there, and they damn well better for $550. So are they all they're hyped up to be? Is Apple taking the audio world by storm and revolutionizing music as we know it? No. Not by a long shot.I'll try to categorize and simplify my thoughts:-Build Quality: In classic Apple fashion, the hardware is very good. Metal and high quality fabrics are present, no Apple logos or graphics to stain the clean and sleek design, and the magnetic replaceable earcups are genius (albeit expensive at $69 a pair).-Controls The button/knob wheel combo is simple yet effective. I much prefer physical buttons to touch controls (The Sony WH-1000XM3's have infuriating touch controls and apparently the M4's aren't much better) and Apple does it right. One button to switch between ANC/transparency mode and no mode at all, and the knob to control the volume as well as play and pause. Super simple, as it should be. However, I couldn't help but notice how little resistance the buttons have, which makes them easy to press. This resulted in me accidentally pressing something almost every time I put on/took off/adjusted my headphones if I grabbed them from the top. Just something to note.-ANC/Transparency Mode: Transparency mode on these is EXCELLENT. Voices almost sound like they're in your head and everything is made not only louder, but clearer as well. Much better than the Airpod Pros. The ANC however, to me was a bit of a let down. It was difficult finding the different between ANC and no mode at all, but I suspect this might have something to do with....-The Fit I have a big problem with the fit. It's a little hard to explain in text but I'll give it a shot. Ideally, when the headphones are put on, the main cans sit flat on your ears and are parallel to each other to create a nice seal around your ear, like this {| |} . But due to the hinge design that connects the main cans to the headband, they have too much area to move around in a sense, and they end up fitting more like this {/ \} , which results in too much pressure being applied at the top of the main cup and not enough at the button, creating an opening at the button of my ear where not only the music escapes through, but outside noise bleeds in as well. I have tried every length and adjusted them in every way possible but that is an unavoidable flaw in the design. Could it be due to my weird head shape? Possibly, but it's not something I've never experienced in over-ear headphones, so I'm blaming Apple for this one.-Sound So they don't fit well and ANC is balls. Could the sound save it perhaps? Will you weep in joy at the Apple engineering that made such beautiful vocals and trembling bass possible? No. I would call it average. SLIGHTLY better than the Airpod Pros. My V-Moda M-100's, almost a decade old, sh!t on these, spit in their face, curb stomp them, pick them up, then sh!t on them once more, all at half the price (and they straight KILL them once I connect them to my FiiO BTR5) all at half the price or so. Sound is okay, bass is lacking for me, volume is shockingly low. Just an overall disappointment.Final Verdict: These aren't bad headphones at all, not by any means. Great build quality, banging transparency mode, and average sound. But for five hundred and FIFTY DOLLARS it should be FANTASTIC sound, with SILENT ANC, and more accessories than a single cable and a DIAPER for a case (which is frankly pathetic). There is much better out there for cheaper. I personally recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4's (I actually have the M3's but they're apparently really similar to the M4's so not enough for me to upgrade but great deal for first time buyers). Great sound, great ANC, great fit, comfortable, wonky controls but not a dealbreaker, with actual useful accessories and a proper carrying case at half the price. Or V-Modas. Or Sennheisers. Or Airpod Pros. Anything within the $200-$300 range really will do anything these do and most likely better. I generally like Apple products and can justify owning my Airpods (both regular and Pros), iPad, and even the Watch, as they offer an experience I just can't quite get with other products, through the hardware and software, but these are a giant swing and a miss, and I will be returning them within the week. I am not rating it 2 stars because they're bad. I am rating it as such for the incredibly bad value for money you're getting.","Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2021",AFXTAPF2YL4PPX5ZK277IBELCC2Q,True,18,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

R1HGABZT03QDP1,4.0 out of 5 stars I wanted to love this product,Janonymous,4,"I wanted to love these - the style, the look, the good reviews, love my Macbook, high price tag, more 'mesh' type ear cushions, etc. Even the case didn't bother me or lightening charger.But style does not exceed comfort or practicalness.These are too heavy, and not so much just sitting on your head, but moving around. The point of Noise cancelling premium bluetooth headphones for me was to be able to work around the house, and use some nice headphones instead of earbuds. I have a big head, so I figured the reviews were wrong about the heaviness, but they are. If you bend down, lean one way, move around too much, they'll slide or fall off. This is a deal breaker 1 for me. They are comfortable otherwise, the band and cushions are amazing, but you can't change the weight or looseness on these, only the up and down adjustment.2nd dealbreaker - definitely can't make music with these. Which probably isn't an issue for most, but if you wanted to use these time to time with music recording, don't even think about it. There's some weird interference there with the internal makeup of the sound (EQ I think?) and the bluetooth delay.That being said, if you love apple, and want to just use these for chilling on the couch wireless or not moving around much, or have a head the size of Joe Rogan or the Rock Dwayne Johnson you should be fine.They look awesome, the volume knob and action knob are super helpful, and the sound is good (not great - not a lot of bass, it's true - I didn't even want bass booming in my ears, but you won't hear much regardless, moreso the vocals) and they are super well quality made (durable, steel, materials, etc) so I can't give it lower than 4 stars on that alone, and they will work for most if you aren't needing to be mobile.No chance you can use these working out or exercising though.","Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2023",AGDSW7XARREGU3FU22WACDDYHEYQ,True,45,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

RGRT1QHSQAXHI,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome if you’re an apple user!,B,5,"I solely use apple devices, and was looking for a noise cancelling headset that could easily work between multiple apple devices. The apple AirPods max does exactly that. I have used other headphones in the past like Sony and Bose but honestly I didn’t like the white noise sound they’d make, and how frequently frustrating it would be to connect the headphones between various apple devices seamlessly.The airpod max are a little overpriced in my opinion. The headphone’s storage case is pretty useless, it offers zero protection to the headphones. It’s not a hard case just a soft one that doesn’t even cover the top band. When I stick these in my bag I’ll actually put them in an old hard camera case because that protects them more than the case apple provided for them.Despite that though it does a very well job of smoothly connecting to my different apple devices depending on which one I’m using. Almost 2 months in on using it and I’ve never had an issue with them randomly disconnecting or not pairing properly, even with non-apple devices like my gaming PC.The noise cancellation is pretty great too, it doesn’t cancel out 100% of the background noises depending on what that noise is and how relative it is to you. It has multiple modes (2 or 3 depending on the device) so you can switch the noise cancelling off if needed.For example, it does a really great job of cancelling the loud construction noises outside my apartment, barking dogs, loud cars (including the construction vehicles) and people talking in the background but it doesn’t do as well as job of cancelling out the noise of my boyfriend streaming sports on the background. It cancels a good amount of the game and his “enthusiasm” but it doesn’t cancel as much as I wish it would.Overall I would highly recommend this to anyone who owns multiple apple devices, wants seamless connection, and is looking for a better noise cancelling solution than what the normal air pods offers.I would not recommend this if you don’t have apple devices or only have one but use android/other operating systems. Yes the noise cancelling feature is great, but at this price point it’s not worth it in comparison to other noise-cancelling headphones priced similarly.","Reviewed in the United States November 7, 2022",AHFEIQHNRL3HZWBDG364V7Q7EDQQ,True,38,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R16MDCN2X9HV03,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Headphones!,dham,5,"I am an Apple fanatic, so I will say that my review isn't completely objective. This is not a sponsored review. I spent my own money on these. I will be honest, I had so much hesitation prior to purchasing these headphones based on some of the reviews. The biggest concerns were all the reviews that mentioned connectivity issues and the condensation issues. I can honestly say, after using these for a solid month, that I have not experienced any of these issues whatsoever. They connect automatically once on my head, and when I am using multiple apple devices, they will switch automatically based on whatever device is playing audio (except my MacBook Pro, but I do not mind manually connecting them. I literally takes two clicks...). The audio quality is probably the best of any headphones that I have ever owned. My favorite features are the immersive seal and the noise cancellation. The design of the headphones allows for your ears to be completely enveloped in sound, and when that seal is combined with noise cancellation, it is like the world around you disappears. I love them. They are pricey, but I have ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS purchasing them. I saved up for them, and they are, in my opinion, worth every. single. penny. I did purchase Applecare+ for an additional 60 dollars. That's a no-brainer, seeing as how expensive these things are. I also bought a thin silicon covering to protect from scratches. All in all, if you have the money, and you love apple products, and you like that premium apple feel, BUY THESE! Totally worth it.UPDATE:2 months in, and they still work great!

You’ll understand once you’ve received your half grand headphones. For the head band theres a silicone band protector here on amazon, j recommend purchasing as well, same for the cushions.

As such, they are designed and meant to be paired with Apple products. You do that, you are good to go.What you do not get: A charger. It uses the same one your iPhone or any other Apple Lightening thing you may have does. It comes with a cable. Mine is still in the box; I just charge from my computer. Apparently, this is a problem. I don't get it :)What you DO get:- A *very* immersive, *very isolated* soundstage. The Noise Cancellation is so insane, it is near ""witchcraft"" levels. It's legit. :)- 'Super Hearing' with Transparency Mode: If you have used this with AirPods Pro and where like ""yeah, ok, this works""...this is more like ""Yeah. I can hear *everything* SUPER CLEARLY. Stop breathing so loud""-levels and the ""mix in"" is really balanced with audio you may be listening to.- Spacial Audio on these things is hard to describe without sounding overly hyperbolic. The directionality is much more dialed in than the AP Pros, the ""behind you"" is really great. I wish it worked on my Mac tho. Maybe in the future.The build on these is like...I have zero concern I will break them. Ever. I believe they could seriously injure someone if swung hard enough. Seriously.A lot of time and testing was put into the mechanisms, resistance of sliding, the sockets for the ear cups that rotate, very smoothly, but also have a firm, strong spring action for grip against your head.Now...there *is* a problem. If you wear glasses, they will start to irritate a little from pushing against the side of your head. it is not the ear cups, which are borderline pillows. it is the pressure/pressing of the arms of glasses into your head. Be aware of this.Handoff works great, call quality is great, very nice audio sep, highs do not sound sibilant unless they *actually are*, the bass is clear, not ""muddy"" and you *will* be hearing what you've been missing with these, like other headphones in this range. That's the really cool thing about these; hearing 'ghost notes' you never had before, studio sounds, etc. These really bring that stuff out.I am ambivalent about the case/'case' controversy. They don't, heh...these things don't need a case. Heh.They are not inexpensive. They also...are not ""cheap"". There's a lot of ""sour grapes"" out there around these. They are indeed, at least twice as good as AirPod pros...so if you like those or the Beats sport wireless earbuds...and like music and stuff...you'll enjoy them.

RXWSOF5UE2MAZ,3.0 out of 5 stars Many caveats and issues,Stephen,3,"Apple introduced some very expensive headphones at $550 (unless you can find a discount on Amazon). They do not come with a real protective case. Apple provides a TACO looking cover for only the ear cups! What is also important to know is there is no off button. If you place them down they go into standby. Only way to put them in a deep sleep to preserve battery life is to wrap them in the poorly design TACO case. Only a third party case or stand with magnets in the precise place will deep sleep these! I ended up buying both (another $75).Since there is no off button you end up with a dead battery if you do not charge them after a few days. Then you must charge them a bit to use them. Kind of defeats the quick connect!Note also there is no way to use these with a wired connection out of the box! BlueTooth only. You would need to buy a $35 Apple cable to used them on a plane or my wired device. Unfortunately I bought and tried TWO of these Apple provided cables and no luck at all getting any audio! The cables are thin and cheaply made (unlike most Apple stuff). Plus they do not work at all. I returned both cables when I saw the Apple forums filled up with people reporting no audio like what I experienced.I am past the point of returning these expensive headphones. So I am making the best of what they are. Now for what they do best. The noise cancellation and sound quality is excellent. The built quality is also quite good with mostly metal and magnetic ear cups that can be easily replaced. Apple has a big edge when you are part of the Apple ecosystem for switching devices and spacial audio. The headphones are a bit heavy, but comfortable to wear.Comparing the AirPod Max to Sony WH-1000XM5 which I bought and returned, I found the AirPods Max to be superior in ANC and sound quality. Found the Sony’s to be very bass heavy and the included software a train wreck. They were lighter and more comfortable to wear.I bought AppleCare so I have some coverage.I hope someone from Apple reads these reviews. Spending as much as I did I probably would have skipped these u til they get improved. Apple NEEDS to provide a REAL protective case and a wired solution that is included and actually works.In the meantime these AirPod Max will only get used in my house with BlueTooth only (shame). My travel headphones will remain my trusty old Bose QC35 that fold small, have a protective case and a wired solution.I cannot recommend these until the bugs and issues are worked out. Since I am writing this in Feb 2023, I think you need to wait for Apple to co e out with a new model addressing these issues.

The sound quality is outstanding, and they're incredibly comfortable, making them perfect for long flights as someone who travels frequently for work.However, I was slightly disappointed that they don't support conversation awareness or adaptive mode, features that would have been handy. Moreover, the noise cancellation, while good, doesn't seem to match the level of the Apple AirPods Pro 2, which is a bit of a letdown.The build quality is excellent, and they fit really well. The battery life is impressive too. But at a price point of $550, I can't help but feel that they're overpriced. If you're an audiophile willing to splurge, these might be for you, but for most, there are more cost-effective alternatives out there.","Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2023",AER3T27H5FGR6JDQFTKHY3KHSBUA,True,2,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R3E7C6GYL03XPB,3.0 out of 5 stars Great product for one year,EliR,3,I got these AirPods Pro for my son. He is in collage he used them every day for a few hours and enjoyed them very much. Great sound quality and noise cancelation. After one year and a week of they got disconnected from all his devises and we went to Apple Store for repair. The tecnifican said there is a problem with Bluetooth module. This is something they see all the time. Since it was 2 weeks after purchase the warranty was not active and hr price of repair was $320. So great product while it’s working but I decided to get my son a new pair from another very reputable company for half price and in case they brake he can get another new pair and it will be a bit over the repair price.

R3DAIN97WM2L8K,4.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic. Also overpriced.,electron,4,"The Apple AirPods Max are everything you may have already heard. They’re fantastic and also wildly overpriced.The design and build are fantastic. They look and feel significantly more expensive than my Bose. Drawing inspiration from both aviation headsets and recording studio units from the 50s, Apple has come up with a really iconic look. The Max is definitely heavier than the Bose I have but by no means intrinsically “heavy”.The fit is good and AirPods are comfortable but it did take me some time to find the right position for me. Noise canceling is superior and invisible compared to any other type I have used. Apple has done well to avoid much ofthat sort of synthetic silence or hiss you get from noise cancelling. Passive mode is great and these work well talking on the phone also. The battery life is good and the two buttons on he right cup feel and work great.Sound quality is excellent as expected with any ,used I have played, again leaning toward natural sound rather than boosted or over boosted bass levels. The Max excels greatly pairs to an Apple TV watching movies.What isn’t so good? They’re too hot to wear for workouts. I prefer something to let my ears breathe more when I’m exercising, so in-ear options may be a better choice. The case is a joke but not totally useless. The problem is while the case does protect the aluminum cups, it isn’t well made and does nothing to protect the comparatively more fragile parts of the earphones. No charger? No problem as have a box full of USB and USB-C chargers already. Another small qualm is because of the case material, when you first unbox the Max, there is a very strong and unpleasant polymer type odor, but it goes away quickly.Finally the biggest problem: the price. I think $350-400 is more reasonable. I had extra money I could afford to spend but I just don’t think $550 is realistic. Apple aims to get you to spend as much as they can and from what I can see of demand and my own spending, they are winning people over. Undoubtedly a cheaper variant will appear eventually and you may do better for your pocket book to wait it out.I love these things. I won’t part with them. But they also cost too much. Your mileage may vary.","Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2021",AGK4EJZJQRXMP5HB346ED7KJDZVA,True,2,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
RR5U6COYVQ65M,2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointed after coming from AirPods Pro,Shnakepup,2,"I've previously used the original AirPods and the AirPods Pro. In particular, I really valued the noise cancellation on the Pro. However, I had issues with one of the Pro earbuds developing a crackling noise. I had it replaced, but after the warranty period expired, then the other earbud developed the same issue. I saw the AirPods Max go on sale and I had a gift card so I took the plunge. This is definitely more than I would normally pay for headphones but I figured that I had a good track record with Apple so far, all things considered, and I assumed the premium cost would be reflected in the quality of the product. Unfortunately, the Max fell short.First, the good: the build quality seems good. The headband is comfortable, and I never get any pain on the top of my head from wearing it for long periods of time (which frequently happens to me with other headphones). The volume dial/button/crown thing is nifty, and I like that there's a dedicated button to toggle back and forth between Transparency Mode and noise cancellation. Similar to the AirPods Pro, it also does an auto-pause thing when you take them off which is much appreciated. The overall sound quality seems really good, though I'm not an audiophile so I can't say much more than that.Some minor gripes: the volume dial/button/crown thing can be a little squirrely. I wish it required a little more resistance to push down or turn. As it is right now, I find myself often accidentally activating it. Also, the auto-pause feature sometimes doesn't work correctly. It definitely knows when it's completely off your head but often doesn't recognize if I've pulled them down around my neck; despite not being on my ears anymore, I can still hear the music or whatever playing. I'm guessing it uses proximity sensors or something to detect if it's ""on"" your head or not, and being on your neck confuses it? I dunno, seems like that's something they should've accounted for, as that's a pretty natural thing to do with headphones like these. Also, seems like half the time if I take them off then put them back on, it'll automatically unpause, but half the time it won't and I need to manually resume. Not a huge deal but irritating and inconsistent. Also, one last minor gripe: the tops of my ears sometimes gets sore in these, because when I put them on, they touch the inner wall of the ear cup (which is covered in rough material). I guess my ears are bigger than what they designed for?Lastly, the problems. Or mostly just the one problem: the noise cancellation doesn't seem all that great. It seems like it *could* be great, or maybe is *supposed* to be, but maybe the shape of my head just doesn't conform to Apple's assumptions. When I wear the Max and have noise cancellation on, it's inconsistent in how it blocks out sound. For instance, if I turn my head to one side, the quality of the cancellation shifts wildly (either from good-to-nonexistent or vice-versa). I work with multiple monitors so this is something I'm doing a lot, and it's very distracting to have the noise cancellation shift so much every time I do this. Also, I've noticed that if I literally press down on the sides (i.e. pressing them more onto my ears) the cancellation gets dramatically better. It seems like the ear cups aren't getting a good seal against my head and thus are letting in too much outside noise. I've tried adjusting the headband in various ways but nothing seems to help.This is a pretty major disappointment for me. Considering the price, I would expect the noise cancellation to be at least on par with the AirPods Pro, if not better. Perhaps they are if you have the right shape head and ears, but unfortunately that's not the case for me. Maybe it's not fair to compare the Max to the Pro, since the Pro are in-ear buds vs the Max's over-ear design. But STILL...look at the price! I'm not sure why these are so much more expensive. If you're looking at both of these, what's the advantage to getting the Max over the Pro? I really can't think of anything that's THAT much better on the Max. Like I said before, maybe the sound quality is much better on the Max, but I honestly can't tell the difference. The one thing that DOES stick out to me is the noise cancellation experience, and these are definitely not as good.","Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2021",AFQCLVOXBQE7FGBWLB5IZ6ZAN4FA,True,1,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R1X268MGSPN4QJ,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice upgrade from Bose 700,D. H.,5,"Had a pair of Bose 700 headphones for several years, and decided to upgrade recently when the ear cups basically disintegrated.I frequently use both my iPad and PC, and it was always a pain getting the Bose to switch between the two without going through the hassle of manually connecting the bluetooth almost every time (usually by having to hold down the pair button on the Bose) which got really annoying.I don't have this issue at all with the AirPods Max. Always instantly connects to the iPad, and then when I turn on bluetooth on my PC, seamlessly switches over.Noise cancelling is great, just as good as the Bose. And I love the transparency mode especially for Meet or Zoom meetings. With the Bose even with noise cancelling turned off I felt like I was talking down in a hole, and as such did not enjoy using them for teleconferencing. Completely different experience with these AirPods. Transparency is like I dont even have then on. When I talk I can hear my voice loud and clear which is great.I was nervous about dropping $500 on these when I could get a new pair of the Bose 700 for ~$300, but so far I am incredibly happy with the decision.","Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2023",AHX7BJUQXO4YTCW7REQZ3IMVS6PA,True,12,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R3JK5NWFUPZ0DG,5.0 out of 5 stars An Excellent Set Of Headphones,N. Hoover,5,"I have Sony and Bose headphones and to me these are more balanced than either the XM4 and the QC35. Are they perfect? No. Are they worth the $500+? No. I would easily recommend these if they were priced around the Sony’s and Bose’s headphones which are these biggest competitors. Pros and cons time!Pros:Balanced soundMetal constructionPhysical buttons for controlsStylishComfortableOne of the best ANC on the marketGood microphones for phone calls and video chatPairs flawlessly with your Apple productsCons:The priceCan be a little heavy due to the metal casingThe “headphone case”No off buttonNo charging mountLightning portAs you can see, the pros out way the cons. In my opinion, I can’t justify the price. I even bought these when they were $50 off. I think the biggest issue people are going to have is the “case” and no power button.The headphones will go into sleep mode to conserve power. In order to do that, you have to put these in the case that doesn’t offer much protection. However, this also allows the headphones to easily connect to whatever Apple device you have then paired to when you’re ready to use them. If you want to take these for traveling you will have to buy a third party case.With that said, these are my favorite set of headphones. This is coming from a long time Bose fan. They sound absolutely fantastic. I use them all the time at home for music and videos. The metal casing makes them durable. The trade off being they can be heavy, and will take some time to get use to.Physical buttons makes these superior to other headphones out there with touch controls. You have two buttons. The Digital Crown which controls the volume and play and stop. The second button controls the ANC. The noice cancel on these are also fantastic. It cancel out most sounds. They do have some issues canceling out high pitched noises like a blender. With that said, they do tone down those higher frequencies.It’s just a shame these are so expensive. I’d recommend them if you have the money to spend and are a big Apple fan. If you don’t have the money the. Sony’s XM4 and Bose’s QC35 are great alternatives.","Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2021",AFB3KKKKUVG2A2U4HGXZNVRZ4USQ,True,9,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R14CKEKNZSHO12,5.0 out of 5 stars I can mute out my family now :),Wen,5,"OMG let me tell you!! I wanted new NC headphones, I upgraded from Sony ZX770BN, which is on the older models of Sony headphones, but it got the job done for a while. Since they were getting old, battery life and bluetooth connection was getting wack, and I was like “ight, upgrade upgradesss!” So here I am now, listening to ‘Chasing Pavements’ by Adele (AMAZING).Okay the details!! I live with 10 other people… I can now live in peace, absolute silence, my whole serenity. I am sane now. The noice cancellation is superior, much better than my Beats solo wireless and Sony.The fit. OMG, ya’ll I was so hesitant when reviews said that it’s heavy. IT’S NOT THAT BAD. I’m an architecture student, so these headphones are on my head literally 24/7. They’re fine! I have 12 piercings on my ears (conch, snugs, rook, tragus, and triple lobes) and the comfort on these are amazing. I have problems with my Beats Solos are they were tighter and smaller muffs, so it would always make my piercings swell or bleed. So comfortably, 100/10.The sound? MY OH MY. Literally went on facetime with my girlies and the sound was soooo surreal. I was engulfed with the sound. And they said my microphone was super clear too! Now imagine with music, imagine with Adele. Yes. It’s immaculate. No more needed to say.Now the controls, I’m a little iffy about. There’s only two buttons to control your music, without your phone. The little dial is mainly for volume, skipping, and pausing. and the other button is for changing transparency to noice control. It’s fine, but I do wish they had the tap features like the regular Apple Air pods earbuds.But overall, this is my review. It’s amazing, it’s def worth the investment. It’s cute, it’s comfortable, it takes you out of this world, it builds your own imagination, it soothes my adhd brain. idk man, this review is up to your interpretation (:Thanks for reading <3","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2022",AGUVWUVEAO37YVL7K6XFXCP4OI4A,True,75,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R1D78RUSCQSKO8,4.0 out of 5 stars AirPods Max are Amazing!,T Man,4,"So first things first in full disclosure, I am an Apple fan so that may influence my review. Like most folks, the pricetag of these headphones is really high. If I wasn't so deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem I may have passed on these. Anyway, I found a new pair on Amazon and the packaging was damaged so saved about $40 and decided to give them a whirl.Likes:- I haven't owned over-the-ear headphones in many years so didn't know what to expect. But they sound amazing! I own a pair of AirPods Pro's that I haven't listened to in a while and I thought they sounded great before I had my Airpods Max. I just used them and wow, they sound terrible in comparison.- The design is all Apple - high quality and while a little heavy they are very comfortable. I have worn them for several hours and haven't experienced the condensation issues that others have. We live in a dry climate so maybe that's a factor?- Noise-canceling is simply amazing. I have a Cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker and made some coffee last weekend and while it makes great coffee, it's really loud. I was wearing my headphones and had to check to make sure I turned them on since I heard nothing.- Call quality is great and the transparency mode makes you think you are not wearing headphones. ExcellentCons- Ok, the case works fine when you are at home but I did buy a more rugged case for traveling. For the price, a better case should be included.- Cost as noted is high - but after just listening to my Airpod Pros, the quality is way better and probably justifies the cost.I have only had the headphones for a few weeks which is why I gave them a 4 out of 5 since my experience is somewhat limited. I am traveling quite a bit over the next few months and will be using them a lot so I'll share more thoughts down the road but so far I am impressed. Also, if you are considering these headphones, check out Brian Tong's review on YouTube. It's long (almost one hour) but is worth checking out.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2021",AGK532WMYGX4XUPCUG2W64URGZMA,True,10,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

I later tried Sony my Sony headphones and for the first time I noticed they felt cheap compared to Apple. These headphones have changed my life for the worse as now I’m realizing how awful my other headphones are.The one thing I don’t like apart from the missing type c or Aux port. The sound quality at first felt like they didn’t sound loud enough but after a day or two I adjusted and learned to appreciate these headphones as now I never get the message saying the volume is too loud. I felt like I was destroying my hearing with my other headphones but these not only are they the most comfortable to wear they protect you from blowing you ear drums.

However, after listening for a while, I found them heavy, not easy to use, and the sound just ok. I thought the spatial was going to wow me, but it seemed more of a gimmick. For the cost of these I traded in my old Bose headphones and got both the new Bose Ultra Headphones and Bose Ultra Earbuds for less than the cost of the Apple headphones. To my ears the Bose are much better and warmer with excellent bass response. Plus they tend to play better with non-Apple equipment and have a headphone jack when needed. The Bose also has their version of spatial (immersive) but again I find it more of a gimmick. It loses separation.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2024",AEWCKWP4FROURMGFQOEVFAA5NJFQ,True,1,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R14CUFTK0PUW0H,"4.0 out of 5 stars Worth the price, if you get them at Amazons price!",Rodrigo Martinez,4,"First off, I thought these were overhyped headphones at first until I actually got them. They fit your head very snug and feel very secure while having them on (I have a medium sized head). The earcups create a good seal around your ear which I have had issues with when trying Beats and Bose.The sound quality is amazing, on par with Sony and Bose, very crisp even up to loud volume and these do get loud. In terms of comfort, theyre great. At first, they may seem a bit tight at first but you get used to it after a couple of hours. I wore them for 3 hours on the train and no complaints, very comfy.Now to the controversial part that everyone is talking about, CONDENSATION! While wearing them for multiple hours, in cold A/C environments, in mildly hot outside temperature and I have not seen a drop of water in the earcups. This may vary with where you live but I think this problem is very select depending on your climate.And if you're like me, you have been checking the reviews that say they got a used pair and what not. I was skeptical too, but mine arrived in authentic apple packaging with an authentic serial number. I will write an updated review in around 6 months to see how they are in the longer run.In the end, I would say these are only worth it if you have an iphone and can get them for $430. If you have an android, I would suggest going with Bose or Sony for the price and since you wont be able to get the most out of these headphones. However, as an apple user from an iPhone to iPad and mac, these headphones work GREAT.","Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2022",AE24OUYXSSIPJB5YQEKK2MRJNSXQ,True,15,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R1W3TKX62Q1RXW,"4.0 out of 5 stars Top Notch Quality, With a Few Issues",Deco Crow,4,"I usually hate writing reviews (doing Amazon's work without getting paid, after all) but it seems like there's a lot of reviews either praising these to the ends of the earth or pitching fits about one or two issues to give them 1 star.I originally tried Sony's XM4s, since lots of reviews seemed to show they were a similar quality for a big price difference. Mine were plagued with connection issues, either unable to connect most of the time or dropping it constantly on Apple, Android, and Windows devices alike. When I saw these available for a rare discount, it made sense to pull the trigger, with a price point only $100 higher than XM4s for much higher quality. The sound is strikingly crisp for wireless headphones, the build quality is insane, the adjustable band works well on heads of all sizes, and it's so easy to swap devices, change noise cancellation, etc.Transparency mode is unmatched, makes it mighty easy to hear what's going on around you without it drowning out your music. Noise cancelling is also great, but I'm not a big fan of how any headphones solve that. Battery life doesn't lead competitors at all, but is more than enough to last many days of active use.Main drawbacks? The price without a discount is really too steep, go for these on sale. The inability to turn them off with a power button instead of the admittedly stupid case is weird, but they barely lose any power on standby mode, so folks are really making a mountain out of a molehill on that point. I haven't experienced condensation issues yet, but will update if that happens. Not including the audio jack at this price point is also absurd, especially when these are being presented as a middle ground between normal headphones and audiophile options.Again, definitely worth picking up if you can score a discount, but I'm not sure I'd be as enthralled at the standard $550 price point.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2022",AFKIZCVA66WSITCVOLWISF7VQSVA,True,1,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

I got these to have something nice yet “consumer” to listen on.Music sounds pretty great. I give it 4.5 stars. I I wish I felt the low end a little more but that’s my only complaint, and it’s a very small one. Overall they sound really good for rock, edm, jazz, etc.Dolby Atmos material is even better. Listening to Apple Music or watching movies on my iPad with spatial audio is really cool, and here I don’t want for low end… on movies the low end really sounds like a subwoofer in a movie theater. The sound is increíble, as is the head tracking.The only thing I didn’t really like was I found when listening to music via my iPhone, if the spatialize audio is turned on, head tracking or not, it hypes up the sound and sounds, frankly, terrible. I suggest turning off the head tracking/spatial audio except for content especially designed for spatial audio. It turns stereo signals into a mix that is NOT how the artist intended. Also I noticed that when listening with spatialize audio turned on for stereo songs, I would literally have ringing in my ears and my eardrums hurt for a while after listening. Heed my warning, spatialize audio for stereo music sounds plain BAD!They seem well built.

RG1F0W52E5C1K,"3.0 out of 5 stars Made of Metal, Sounds like Mud",Rob DeGutis,3,"I use AirPods Pro’s for causal listening/work and Sennheiser HD598cs for pleasure/analytical listening.Summary:These are for people who can afford a bit of a step up in audio quality, build quality and noise reduction from the Pro’s. The Max tries to combine both, but fails due to poor audio quality and clunkiness. If you are looking for audiophile grade quality, you are better off getting AirPod Pros and separate high-end cansPro’s:-Attractive and well-built.-Noise reduction works very well.-Seamless connectivity with iPhone 12 Pro.-Favors rumbly Bass and Mids.Con’s:-Sound. Significant high-frequency roll off kills any sound stage or imaging.-Weight. When laying down or looking up, all that metal kept sliding off my head.-Fatiguing. High clamping pressure and rough ear pads are good for noise isolation, but you won’t ever forget they’re up there. You’ll also activate the poorly placed crown frequently.-Price. Whoa.Sound Continued:Although the iPhone sadly doesn’t offer a custom EQ, in…“Settings/Accessibility/AirPods/AirPods Max/Audio Accessibility Settings/Headphone Accommodations”they’ve deeply, deeply buried a means to bring some badly needed sparkle back at there cost of accuracy. I’ve found that while “Brightness” set to “Slight” brings music up out the mud, it is too heavy handed and does other audio trickery like raising the levels of quieter sounds that takes you further away from your original recording.Spatialize?And please, turn off Spatialize Stereo/Audio. It’s the audio equivalent of the Deep Fusion effect that ruins iOS photography. While it does add a great sounding EQ effect, but you have no idea what the original song or your headphones really sound like. And no, Spatial Audio for Atmos sources does not move sounds up and down or sound like true multichannel. It simulates an expanded sound stage, but never vertical.Examples of Muddy Highs:1. Björk’s “Crystalline”. At 1:45 When she sings “With our hearts, we chisel quartz”, all of the sibilants and her fantastic rolling “R” in quartz are totally lost in the mud.2. Dave Matthew’s Band’s “Don’t Drink the Water”. Carter Beauford’s snare drum is significantly muted. I also had to set Headphone Accommodation to Brightness to even hear the shaker.3. Spirited Away’s “It’s Hard Work”, and “The Stink Spirit.” The warm reverb evoking a steamy bathhouse in “Work” during the intro is lost to the mud. The Stink Spirit loses most of the subtle environmental sounds like the tapping in time at 10 sec in.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2022",AHVZQOYEWEWLYDTNXLNTYLBT4V5A,True,4,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R1YDKZKJFI4U49,4.0 out of 5 stars Best sounding headphones with cons,Hot Dog,4,"The hype is real...these indeed are the best sounding headphones on the market even being two years old. Yes, better than the newer Sony XM5 and Bose Quiet Comfort. The sound is clear, balanced and refined with very good definition between the highs and lows. The bass is not overpowering or muddied which I found was slightly the case on the XM5 or lacking in the case of Bose. Using this with spatial audio/Dolby Atmos tracks is a next level listening experience...you will never want to go back.That said, the weight, size and look are a problem. They are HUGE and make you look like an air traffic controller wearing noise protection ear muffs. The weight is definitely noticeable and not comfortable...it took me a few days to get used to the weight and even then still find it annoying at times.If you can tolerate these cons, and the price is not an issue, then look no further...these are the most immersive, best sounding headphones out there.","Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2023",AH3LJARZUQSM46NTGMS73LSZRQRQ,True,6,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

PERIOD!!",Scott,5,"Considering how things have changed with stores selling audio products, it's not possible to go into a store to buy headphones and 'compare' a variety of headphones to decide which you like best. So, I purchased the Bose NC 700 Headphones, Sony WH-1000XM4 Headphones, and Apple AirPod Max Headphones all in the span of three months. The clear winner in all categories.... Apple AirPod Max.1. Superior, clear, crisp, sound with spatial separation of vocals and instrumentation.2. Easily connects to all Apple products (computers, iPads, iPods, and also to LG TV;s, and Dell Computers.3. Very comfortable in feel on the sides of the head, over the ears, and snug fit on top of head.4. Noise cancellation is like BAMN!! No sound outside the headphones period. But also is adjustable.5. Snug fit, cushy ear pads, with deep pockets to encase ears with space for audio to surround the listener.6. Controls are few, creative & unique, and function well.7. The headphones look and feel of top quality, and professional sturdy.8. Uh... did I mention they sound Great!!!If you love to hear, and feel, all the intricacies and nuances music you listen too, this is the best purchase.UPDATE: 28 Dec. 2021I have come to learn that this headset is also a complete extension of your iPhone. What does that mean? When you say ""Hey Siri"" you can ask anything that you would ask if you were talking directly into your phone. i.e. ""Hey Siri"" increase volume, decrease volume, next song, prior song, send email, send text, what time is it, and any questions you would ask Siri when researching something on the web. It can and will notify you of text messages you receive as well as emails if you have chosen the settings for it to do so. It gets no better than this.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2021",AE46EMNO7UNVOLO46BAAVIXXQCEQ,True,5,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R1ZPKK233MJRVN,2.0 out of 5 stars great at first,mykey78,2,"So, after 6 months of owning these, I feel like I can write an honest review. My initial impressions were amazing. I lost some hearing in my youth, so I really appreciate quality audio equipment. The sound was great, the microphone worked flawlessly, and overall, I was very happy; about a month ago, I started getting a hissing feedback sound in the right ear cup, especially when I have the sound canceling at a minimum that wasn't present before. I can still use the product, but for what you pay for these, that is unacceptable. I work in a very hot environment; They drip moisture from perspiration at room temperature conditions. The humidity from your body condenses on the aluminum body inside the earcup and after a long use it literally drips sweat from the moisture of your body due to the metal body being slightly cooler than your skin. This is under normal use, I can't imagine using them for brisk physical activities. The moisture may be what caused the hissing feedback noise.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AGSUM3J3EPNTD6FFMTJ2CFPKZ5TA,True,1,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,
R2MJQCBHD23ZQL,4.0 out of 5 stars Not worth 550?,Jeff S.,4,"To me this is just a meh. The only reason i would pick this over other bluetooth headphones is the built quality/aesthetics/ease of use.My advice is to shop around for a much lesser price. 450 and under seems reasonable enough. I'm glad i didn't pay full price. With that said, I'm quite satisfied. Probably would've been disappointed if i paid 550.Sound. This is good. Just good because at least it's clean. Bass is definitely thin imo. The preset EQ don't help. I personally have it at flat or off. Any other preset EQ distorts the over all quality of the sound. Ath m50btx is better in delivering all the frequency. (And if wired with dac/amp, then that's game over for the airpods max) over all the sound is likeable. The NC and passthrough is definitely the icing on this product.Another advice. If you don't need the NC/passthrough or not really in deep in the ecosystem, you can probably get by with the competition brands. Senheiser, Sony, Bose and plenty more to choose from.My review seems like I'm taking a jab at this product. Well, I'm not. I just don't want your expectations high. If you are somewhat a collector of headphones, this is a good addition. Just don't expect too much out of the sound. Everything else is a 5 stars though. My fav headphones/iem: isine10. Monolith m570. Beyerdynamic 80ohm. Ath m50xbt. Fidue a83.I just remembered the battery. It sucks...! I haven't put it through the test, but i suspect this will not last 20 days even if you don't use it. It drains even in the bra case.Well.

R1VMFVAZ1SFNCR,"5.0 out of 5 stars If you have the money, these are incredible.",Amazon Customer,5,"I purchased these with a stipend, so luckily I didn't have to pay out of pocket. Otherwise, I would've been satisfied with the Sony XM4's (especially when they're on sale for $250 at the time of writing this).I had originally purchased all 3 of the major noise cancelling competitors to see which one I liked best. The Bose QC45's that just released were a major disappointment to me, getting distorted as the volume increased and lacking any character in the EQ profile. They were super light and comfortable, but didn't sound nearly as good as I was hoping. Those were returned.I purchased the Sony XM4's and was very impressed. With punchy bass and clean delivery of vocals and high end details, for the price, I definitely wouldn't regret buying those out of pocket. Even then, there wasn't as much detail and I still found myself wishing something else was there to wow me.I put the AirPods Max on, and I was BLOWN AWAY. The quality of sound out of a bluetooth, noise cancelling pair of headphones was incredible. I had heard things in songs I've listened to for years that I'd never noticed before. Everything is perfectly balanced, nothing is overpowering or muddy. I was hoping to have the best of both hifi headphones with the convenience of a bluetooth set, and I think this is as close as I can get.The one thing that is the most annoying is the wired solution, which doesn't even work if the headphones die. As a video editor, this is beyond frustrating.Other than that, I will continue to proudly consider myself an Apple fanboy, and one who is suckered into spending money on good marketing and beautifully designed products.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2021",AEVSEZNJ4CUKQVBIDUJ37BSW5PWQ,True,7,Color: Space GraySet: Without AppleCare+,

R2320IP18Y7SB1,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Headphones I've Ever Owned,W. Mitchell,5,"I now own two pairs of ANC Bluetooth headphones and one pair of Samsung's Buds Pro. The Bose QuietComforts are by far the best sounding and have the most effective noise cancellation. They also cost what the other two cost, combined, so there's that.That said, I believe the QuietComforts are worth every penny. I never owned any of the earlier iterations of the QCs or the Ultras, so I can't compare them, but these sounded amazing right out of the box. Some minor tweaks with the simple EQ, and they are meeting my every expectation. I have listened to lots of music and audiobooks on my phone, as well as watching TV. They sound amazing with whatever they're playing. The setup couldn't be simpler, and the app is very easy to navigate. The EQ is limited, but it seems to be more than enough to tailor them to your preferences.The microphones work very well for calls and meetings. ANC is very effective. It would be nice to be able to turn ANC completely off when it's not needed, but it's not really an issue for me. 24 hours of battery is more than enough. I know that's not really much compared to even significantly cheaper headphones, but I imagine smaller, lighter batteries contribute to their light weight and overall comfort. Bose engineers know what they're doing. Having truly comfortable headphones with amazing sound quality is more important than being able to go a week without charging. They last 6 times longer than my buds with ANC, so I'm good with a whole day.The case, and the ability to fit into the small case is a nice bonus. This makes them very easy to pack.I'm more than satisfied with these headphones, and would not hesitate to buy another pair if needed.","Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2024",AGG3YY77QU7HEFRQWJHGOFNTZBOA,True,75,Color: Cypress Green,
R208BZ1RSLYA0X,"5.0 out of 5 stars Best quality, superior sound and comfort !",Chuckles !,5,"Bose is known for superior quality and functionality and these headphones deliver all that and more. Bose does not disappoint with this model on any level. From the superior sound quality to the design, comfort and wearability Bose is a five star with this pair of high quality headphones. I’d give it ten stars if it were possible. I just can’t say enough about the superior noise cancellation and sound quality in addition to the wearability. The excellent ergonomic design allows extremely comfortable long term wearing. The performance is impeccable as I am able to wear them all day to drown out annoying noises even when I’m not listening to anything. It’s very relaxing noise cancellation for meditation and relaxation with or without sound. Battery life is very long maybe as long as six hours or more of constant listening although I haven’t timed it yet. This model has an animated “Siri” type voice that tells you how much battery life is left as soon as you turn it on so you can charge it before use if necessary. They are great for focusing and concentration. So lightweight and ergonomically correct that I forget I’m wearing them sometimes. Time flies when I use them while multitasking cleaning house and listening to prerecorded books, lectures, video recipes, Tv shows, etc. I’m completely satisfied with my purchase experience and highly recommend this product.

RUR84RZ9061M0,5.0 out of 5 stars ANC HEADPHONE COMPARISON: BOSE QUIETCOMFORT / 1MORE SONOFLOW / BEATS SOLO PRO / AIR PODS PRO,ITMCT,5,"I’ve owned & extensively used the Beats Solo Pros & Air Pods Pros. I gave the Beats to my daughter as the ‘on-the-ear’ design was causing me pain on flights. I migrated to the AirPods Pros hoping I’d get similar performance to the Beats with more comfort and less bulk on flights. Ultimately, the Air Pods Pros just won’t stay in my ears and the ANC just isn’t as effective due to the lack of ear covers or better plugs. So recently I ordered the new Bose QuietComforts and the 1More Sonoflows to compare. I was hopeful on the 1More product due to being on sale for $67 and that the price savings would outweigh any deficits. But ultimately I am going with the Bose QCs. This is my personal opinion and what works best for me. Keep in mind I have not extensively tested the Bose or 1More yet, but spent a day alternating between the two so this is based on initial impressions. Categories are in personal order of importance.COMFORT/DESIGN: I gave up the Beats due to pain/pressure from prolonged use of the on the ear cups. I am also not a fan of the Air Pods Pro design, nor getting them to fit in my ears well and stay (I love the original air pods, and I’ve tried multiple buds for the Pros). I have a large head so the Beats had to be fully extended to be on my head properly which probably increased pressure. They fit my adult daughter much better. The Bose QCs don’t require full extension on me, completely cover my ears, and the cups are really soft. The 1More product covers completely, and is comfortable, but heavier & puts more pressure around my ears than the Bose, so I’m skeptical if I’d want to wear them more than an hour or so. The pressure is a drawback especially given the ANC performance noted next.RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > Beats SoloPro > Air Pods ProANC: In my immediate comparison of the Bose QCs and the 1More Sonoflow, there was a large difference in noise cancellation. I use an infrared heater in my office sometimes that is pretty noisy. Comparable to airplane noise but quieter. The Bose is very effective against it despite fitting looser than the 1More product. But the Bose has less options than the Beats for ANC modes and I found the Beats to be slightly better at full ANC than the Bose and quicker to switch modes. The Air Pods are at a disadvantage here being an earbud product but they are effective and travel light. The 1More product was the worst performer on ANC for me.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Bose QuietComfort > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.SOUND/EQ/APP: I always found the Beats Solo Pros to be balanced, clear, dynamic and pleasant. Integrated with Apple, they worked great though many audiophiles will complain about the lack of EQ adjustments. I liked the simplicity of them and not having to have an additional app. Same goes for the Air Pods. The Bose Sound is very good, as you would expect from Bose, and their App is simple and ok. Out of the box very good and you can tune them to preference. The 1More Product out of the box is definitely at the bottom of the pile. It had an almost metallic, chunky, machine sound to me. You can adjust them, update firmware, and tune them with the app which made the largest difference in the performance compared to the others. The app did have a neat white noise feature with some different options. It also had twice as many EQ adjustments points over the Bose. Ultimately, I enjoy the Bose sound the most followed by the Beats and AirPods and then the 1More, but once tuned all are very good, especially if ANC with music or video on an airplane are your target use.RANKING: Bose QC > Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY: For me, I love the Beats functionality. Buttons are intuitive and easy to use, typical tactile Apple design. AirPods are similar. So far the Bose is ok, it’s intuitive and the buttons seem like they will be easy to learn. The 1More Sonoflow is last here. All buttons on the right side, the power button in front doubles as a function button and for me it’s awkward trying to find it on the front. The 1More is last by a bit for me here.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > Bose QC > 1More SonoflowCASE: Beats Case is cheap and not protective at all. AirPods are AirPods. The 1More Case fits but is a bit bulky, rounded, and the included accessory net is too small. The Bose Case is well made, stiff, protective, has a large accessory net, and is rectangular shaped. Personally I see it fitting in a carry on laptop bag or backpack much easier.RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > AirPods Pro > Beats Solo ProBATTERY LIFE: This is of limited importance to me. But it seems to get tons of mention in every online review you read. The headphones all have insanely long run times compared to older devices. I always charge before a trip and never seem to end up with dead devices. Charge your stuff.

R2Q5DR459SZ1O4,5.0 out of 5 stars Best overall noise cancelling headphones on the market.,Jackson Stublar,5,"These headphones are great, I’ve tested the four of the most popular pairs of over ear noise canceling headphones and these are my brief take aways:This pair of Bose: Great sound and noise cancellation, long battery life, they fold down to a great size, and the color is perfect. I also like that they have a physical on switch and sound buttons, this makes switching between devices far easier and is a great added convenience. One downside is the lack of automatic pausing when you take them off.Sony XM 5: The gold standard in sound and noise cancelation. I had them for a year and a half before switching to this pair of Bose. The only reason behind this is the portability. The XM 5 do not fold so the storage form factor is quite inconvenient. But if this is not an issue for you I would suggest them over Bose. My only other gripe with these is the on/off switch being a button and the lack of physical buttons for volume and pausing. This pair of Bose are far superior in this category.Sony XM 4: Also great sound and noise cancellation plus they fold down. However I give the slight edge to the Bose.AirPod Max: These are quite popular but I have never been a fan. They do not fit as well as the others, they’re very heavy, you are limited on use with non Apple devices, they don’t have an on switch, and they have many other quirky flaws. Their strongest upside is the great transparency mode, however I wouldn’t consider that the driving factor in the noise cancelling headphone market.All in all, I find this pair of Bose to be the best overall product on the market. They are the most convenient option in terms of daily use while having strong technical specs. However, if you are looking purely for the best specs and the convenience and travel functionality do not impact you, the XM 5 may be the way to go.","Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2024",AEITW3U5WZCIL4EE6Q6VK53ZTPJQ,True,50,Color: Cypress Green,
ROG20CQUWLEBQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful sound quality, somewhat flimsy",VM Express,4,"I've had these Bose QuietComfort NC Headphones for about a month now, and I really like how they feel and sound. For context, I have tried out about 5 different pairs in the last 6 years, starting with some Plantronics PRO's back in 2017, which i still use occasionally for travel. Then I moved to some Sony ones which I did not like. All of these other headphones were wireless and noise cancelling in the $100 to $150 range. They each had some shortfall that made them hard to use. Honestly out of all my previous headphoen the Plantronics were the best in quality and durability and Battery life. Sony always had connectivity issues and would crash randomly. Even the mid range model WHCH710N which had a lot of issues. They would randomly crash during zoom calls or listening to music. Happened about 3-4 times a week, it was getting really annoying.I decided to tier up my headphones because I use them for work daily. I thought it was a worth while investment. I decided to go with Bose because of the name recognition and because I have seen many of my peers use them (Im a Software Engineer).My first impressions of the Bose headphones were :- Light- Easy to setup - reliable bluetooth connection (something Sony was lacking)- Excellent sound quality (Best sound quality - on par and slightly better than my Plantronics)- Comfortable (The most comfortable out of all the other headphones I've used)To elaborate further. A common pain point I've experienced is difficulty pairing and dealing with unstable bluetooth connections with my other headphones. I rightfully assumed that this was a price point issue, because I have not had that problem with the Bose headphones. The Bose headphones were easy to setup, they also have apps to help with it. But you can use them without any apps.They are very comfortable and fairly light, comparing to others i've used. I sometimes wear these for 6-10 hours a day and I never have that weird ear pain that you can develop from wearing headphones for long. I have very big ears so that is saying something.Sound quality is excellent. Deep bass with excellent sound range, very satisfying to listen to. They also have a great volume range. This is what Bose is known for so they definitely get this right.CON 1:They do feel rather flimsy. For this price point I expected more metal parts. The materials look well made and have excellent form factor. The headphones however are completely plastic from what I can tell. I feel like one good tug would snap the hinges on the ear pieces. This is a serious concern when you're wearing lose clothing or a hoodie. The headphone could get caught in the folds of your clothing and if were to pull hard or fast while going through the motions you might break them. I have no data to back this up obviously because I am not going to throw away perfectly good headphones to test that theory but you can sort of tell by holding them and pulling on them a little.CON 2:Battery life isn't great. If I forget to turn them off at the end of my work day they somehow continue to deplete the battery. The following morning they are already at 50% battery. So that is 50% a day with only 6-8 hours of actual work (active use). For reference, my old Plantronics headphones last for several days without needing a recharge. I have gone on to use them for 5+ days without having to charge them. Even the mid-range Sony headphones perform ""slightly"" better than this. I know it's good practice to turn them off after you're done but one forgets to do that far more often than one would think. There is room for improvement here.Overall i'd say these are excellent headphones with great sound quality and form factor. Do take a little extra care because they are not the most durable headphones out there.

R2C9CAJWGDVJCG,5.0 out of 5 stars ADD TO CART,Samantha R.,5,"These are the best because:- my beats microphone sucks - nobody can ever hear me and I use headphones primarily for work - they are the least flexible, comfortable and noise cancelling- Sony microphone not too much better, every time I use them I have to go to the app and disable the speak to chat feature - so the second I start singing to my song, they go into listening mode until you shut up for 5 seconds so I don’t feel they are user friendly and the battery life is worst of the 3These are my first pair of Bose and I’m kicking myself for not getting some sooner. Most comfortable, best microphone, most flexible and by far the highest quality of noise cancellation.

R1BS7PY9NIRGOX,5.0 out of 5 stars Really amazing,frankfrank,5,"I have had lots of $40-60 headphones in my life and a few that did noise cancelling, and these blow them all out of the water by a huge margin.If you have some music on and noise cancelling enabled you will absolutely not hear your kids/wife in the same room unless they yell very loudly or happen to speak sharp/loud/quick at a perfect break in the music. These should be more heavily marketed to fathers everywhere to allow them to get 30 minutes of peace after work. Even without the music on it still blocks out as much noise as an average set of shooting earmuffs.In the ""aware"" mode you'll hear everything in your life just as good as you would with a single headset off your ear and the other one on, playing music.The bluetooth works great, connecting to multiple devices (phone and PC etc) at once with no foolish rules/policies that make it annoying.The other reviewers saying you have to have an app to use these are definitely wrong. You can install the app if you want extra features but you can also just pair it to your phone/tablet/pc like any other device and use it as-is. That's exactly what I did and it works great with all the standard features you would expect.Excellent hardware/buttons etc:- L side button switches between NC and ""aware"" mode, great feature to have in an easy to hit button- R side main button: single tap pauses whatever is playing, double tap jumps to next song, triple tap goes back- R side volume up and separate volume down buttons intuitively located- On button is also slide-and-hold for pairing: great feature that is impossible to do accidentally- USB-C charging- port to use hardwire cable to connect directly if you cannot understand the blueteeth thing or want to play something from a device that has no bluetooth or won't pair.Favorite feature: plug in the 2' hardwire cable (which has a tiny but good inline mic on it) and let it dangle or tuck in a shirt pocket: you now have a top quality, silent, noise cancelling headset with a good mic (without changing any mode, hitting buttons etc) that allows you to talk on the phone in bliss. Now instead of yelling at my kids to be quiet every 5 minutes that I'm on the phone, I just put these on and have a great phone call.In the small house that we live in these have made my life a lot better and allow me to let my kids run around loudly having fun at times when I just want some quiet, and when I would have otherwise made them tone it down.The only downside to know about is that these are effective enough to where you need to be careful not to use the noise cancelling when you have much going on that you need to pay attention to. For example: you would not hear your sink overflowing or a pot boiling over, I didn't hear my woodstove fire getting too hot the other day, you won't hear early warnings of kids having trouble (probably wouldn't hear choking etc but would still notice actual screaming nearby). You would still hear something break or a loud whack etc, but probably wouldn't hear a vehicle pull up in your driveway. It does to some extent take away a major ""sense"" so you can't use it as often as you might like.For those other times, like if your wife is cooking and can hear the kids for you if there is trouble, and you just want to relax, I feel like I would almost pay the purchase price of these per week that I got to use them it is so awesome.","Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2024",AHXY35FZ3NHNVNYNIINCKSNQ3G7Q,True,24,Color: Black,
R92VYG3ZZBP6D,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones but Case is Not,Irene Tiefenthaler,5,"I ordered these and they came quickly and as expected. The headphones themselves are good quality and sound really good. I love that there is a ""quiet"" button that cancels the noise and an ""aware"" that lets you continue to hear your music and the outside world. What I am not happy with is that the second time I used the case the zipper split and it won't open and close. I contacted their customer service on Facebook because I heard this was the fastest route. They basically said, ""well we are out of those so click notify me and then you can order some."" When I replied to them and said they were brand new and I felt like they should supply a new case at their expense, they replied, ""I understand that I.., but at this time, I do not have an estimated date on when we are expecting the next shipment of the carry case. I do recommend you use the 'notify me' button on the product page as mentioned previously, and when they do come available, you can drop us a message here, and we will be happy to assist you. That was a month ago. It just feels like they should have put me on the list to get me a new case, not sit around waiting, jumping through hoops for a case.

RPDWV79PD02YI,5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful sound and excellent noise cancellation,Consumer,5,"I have an old pair of those quiet comfort headphones. I’ve been in love with them for years. I live near some warehouses that constantly have tractor trailers coming in and out and the noise cancellation has been a godsend for me. My current ones are getting old and looking their age so I decide to get a new one. These or even better than my old ones. They’re easy to use. I can actually set where I want the noise cancellation for different levels. Also, it’s very easy to answer my phone and talk to people while I’m listening to audiobooks. That was the only disadvantage to my old pair I could never get them to answer the phone. This one just does it with the flick of my finger on the little button on the one headphone. People say they are really expensive but to me you get what you pay for and I will gladly pay for these. My final thought is that I do not have to charge this one as often as I had to charge my old one.

There's always a comfort issue with me. I always had to buy aftermarket pads just to get the things comfortable because they always squish into on-ear headphones.The Bose headphones are the most comfy wireless headphones I've ever owned and it's not even close. The sound is fantastic too. I'm sure the Sony's are ""technically"" better or something, but what the heck is the damn point if I have to take breaks every 45 minutes to avoid a headache!Anyway, they sound great, they're very comfortable.I mostly use ""aware"" mode and it's miles better than the xm4's I used to own. I can actually hear my surroundings or if someone's trying to get my attention at work. Noise cancellation mode is pretty good too for things like yard work or whatever also.They were an impulse buy but I'm a huge fan now.I should also mention they're incredibly lightweight. REALLY good clamp without giving me a headache either. Also unlike the xm5, the build quality is great despite them feeling so lightweight - proving you don't need to sacrifice build quality for weight.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AFLI56ABZB4GYAIB4NILQDVKDHCQ,True,4,Color: Black,

When you're on an airplane, you literally cannot hear the engine. Sound quality is amazing. Battery life seems pretty decent, although I tend to wear headphones in spurts, not all day long.I also like that you can use these as corded or wireless.Really, the only issue I had was that on the plane, I would occasionally get some interference; however, forwarding to the next track always fixed it.

I tried all of the steps they said to take, and none of it made a difference. I'll be returning these. I have a pair of Soundcore Q45s and have had no problems with them, and they cost $100 less.

He uses his constantly, and absolutely loves them.I ""cheaped out"" and got some Sennheiser headphones a few years back, and they were very nice, but I eventually broke down and bought these Bose on sale late last year (always best to buy these when they're on sale), and the sound quality is just phenomenal. It did take some getting used to the feature differences (buttons vs. swiping for volume, etc), but truly my ONLY complaint was that I had to purchase the 2 prong airline adapter separately (these used to be included with purchase, and my Sennheiser came with one, but it doesn't fit the Bose). I travel internationally, and some airlines still require the 2-prong adapter. I just purchased one separately. Unfortunately, learned the hard way though on a long international flight last year that the 2 prong adapter was still needed on some airlines (and that it was not included with purchase), and thus couldn't use these on the plane to watch movies.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2024",AG62ZCV3I3AZNKIB7FD3ZYOHFOKQ,True,2,Color: Cypress Green,
R2V6Q4TZIQ2ILC,5.0 out of 5 stars HOLY MOLY !!!,V,5,"if you're in the market for noise-cancelling headphones then I suggest these! Bose is what we use at the private aircraft manufacturer I work at for the headsets in all the planes. The brand itself is fudging awesome and reliable as a son of a gun. Their main focus is sound quality and background noise cancellation. I've had Beats solos (club editions, solo 3, and Beats Pro earbuds), JBL (earbuds and headphones), and I've used several other brands claiming they're the best. Music is obviously very important to me, and I'm part-time in a home office, so I use headphones for meetings and videos. The only thing I could possibly nit-pick about them is that the Beats solo 3s have a much longer battery life, but these do last all day!! And they fully charge within 8 hours MAX. Also, they come with an AUX cord, so you can connect them to your compatible devices without Bluetooth! Recently, I bought the Bose QC 45 headphones in moonstone blue (color doesn't affect the quality of sound or anything but HOLY MOLY IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL), and HOLY CRAP!! They're worth every cent, I swear by them! I slip these bad boys on (no audio) and my fan (on high) TV (on 10-15/40-50), and all chatter and other background noises get wiped out immediately. It feels like your ears get plugged. (My dad and younger sister said the same!) When you play something in them it's crisp and clean-cut audio, and you can forget about hearing anything else with them on. I'm absolutely flabbergasted, that's why I'm putting y'all on these!! The Sony WH1000s are overrated like a son of a gun. If you're gonna pay $350 for any headphones, I'm begging you to make it these!!! I'm beyond happy, and I'm so glad I decided to buy these.

The noise cancellation is good. But given the cost of these headphones I cannot say these Bose’s are worth it. The cord for non-Bluetooth applications is proprietary to cost you money down the road. The wired impedance match to a big screen tv is terrible. You TV has to be up full to hear thru the Bose just modestly. AND noise cancellation doesn’t work when on the wire. I also find the headphones uncomfortable after a couple hrs. I would definitely not buy these again knowing what I know now.I found the chat support to be near useless. The telephone technical support was good, but I really should have needed to call them at all to untangle their apps and get them to actually work. Then there’s the legalities:You should be aware that Bose is surveilling you. Parts of the agreement is vague enough one really doesn’t know how much the devices is surveiling. I can say if I read this agreement before buying these phones I never would have selected the Boses product. Before buying this product you should examine their privacy statement at their website.

However, these frequently go on sale for $100 off, which is when I would suggest purchasing.- Transparency/Pass-through mode is a bit lackluster, to the point where I’d rather take the headphones off if I’m going to converse.- Time will tell how well-supported the Bose phone app is in the long-term.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AFCFF7IAMTM6ZUA4EJPYYL7XPPYA,True,1,Color: Black,

R1S2FKSWT48Z8L,"3.0 out of 5 stars What a letdown! Skip these, save on a cheaper pair or wait for a true upgrade",Essay Bee,3,"I bought these to upgrade my previous pair of noise cancelling headphones, which were a cheaper pair by Anker. A while back I had a non-ANC pair of Bose that I loved dearly until I updated to ANC, so I assumed these would be great!Well, unfortunately not. Honestly, save your money—there are cheaper pairs that offer mostly the same benefits.I'll start with the good. Bose headphones feel great. They're comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, and they're not so bulky or heavy that it is too noticeable. Truly exceptional in this respect. The sound was a step-up from my previous pair, though not lightyears better. Annoying for the higher price, but it's fine. Battery life is better than I was told to expect. USB-C port is a nice upgrade from older stuff.Now for the down sides. For a long stretch I was getting frequent (like every 2-3 minutes) cut-outs and static sounds. A reddit user suggested I remove the much-praised Bose app from my phone to fix the problem, and it did! But if the app that's supposed to improve the headphone causes them to function worse... seems like a pretty big flaw! Removing the app largely fixed the issue, but there are still plenty of moments where the sound just cuts out for a second. I know this happens with bluetooth headphones, but it happens far more frequently with these fancy Bose than it does with AirPods or the much cheaper Anker Soundcore set I had.The biggest flaw, though, is the microphone. It is borderline unusable, and it's what prompted me to write this review just now. My current pair is actually my second. Sent my first back because the microphone was *literally* unusable. The replacement pair works better, but good luck using it on a phone call without someone regularly saying ""Hello? Are you still there?"" I have not tried the wired microphone—I assume it is better, but the fact that the built-in microphone is this bad at this price point is unforgiveable. I've had two pairs of AirPods and the aforementioned Anker ANC headphones... all of which were at least USABLE for calls. This is truly a joke with these, and I can attest that it is not a one-off issue.I still use these because the sound is fine enough and they're very comfortable. I keep them at my desk and use them only to listen to music while I work... but I bought these with the expectation that they would be at least passable for audio/video calls, and that's just laughable now.Get something cheaper, or save up for the better Sony or Apple pro headphones. I got these on sale so it's fine, but I would never recommend these to anyone else.","Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2024",AHL3T5IKQW2ZASHBALXMLIOADHMQ,True,11,Color: Cypress Green,

R22QR3F4QFPLDT,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome Noise Cancellation!!,Amazon Customer,5,"I bought these because I wanted to have headphones that blocked outside noises while enjoying listening to my music. These do not disappoint! You can enjoy the noise cancellation even if you’re not listening to music if you’re wanting to read in a noisy environment for example. I have never had any headphones quite like this before. You can choose between Aware mode that allows outside noise to filter in if you need to be more aware of your surroundings and Quiet mode that hushes most noises around you. The ear cups make a nice seal around your ears that cuts out a lot of noise even without the noise cancellation enabled. With the Quiet mode enabled and music turned on, the world around you becomes silent. You can see people’s mouths moving but hear nothing.The audio quality is amazing and with the Bose app on my cellphone, I can adjust the low, mid and high frequencies to fine tune the sound. The battery life has been great.Only problem that I have experienced is that in order to register the warranty for your headphones with Bose, you’ll need the serial number, which is under one of the ear cup covers. You have to take off the inner ear cup insert. That’s not the problem: putting it back on is. If you don’t remount it properly, the noise canceling doesn’t work for that ear. Maybe you won’t have that problem like I did, but before I figured out what was wrong, I thought that I had defective headphones.I hope my experience helps you as you decide whether or not to keep this model of headphones on your list of choices.","Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2024",AHKMDX5TJ22LF2U2HP2PFI5NB34Q,True,5,Color: Cypress Green,

R1AC58E4VI0C2P,5.0 out of 5 stars Music to my ears!,DDAY,5,"I just received these Sennheiser Momentum 4 cans about 7 days ago. I bought them for $270, and now I see you can get them $20 less. I made the purchase, despite the negative reviews posted on Amazon simply because I have learned that reviews don't tell the whole story. Such as often times when it comes to Bluetooth devices, there will be a new firware/update that will need to be done, depending on how old the product is. In my case, that was the case. The firmware update was easy, took maybe a minute or two, and I was off and running. I have owned, and sold several headsets, from JBL, Beats, SkullCandy, Sony and yes, Bose. Now, for me, and how I like my music to sound, the Sennheiser 4s are by far the best sounding Bluetooth headphone to grace my melon. Mids, highs and lows work amazingly well. Wind and string instruments sound crisp, and suppurb! The lows/bass work harmoniously with the above mentioned. The Sennheiser equalizer is easy to use, and gets the job done. Touch controls: they take getting used to, but, once you adapt, it works great. Yes, at times you may pause music when touching the right ear cup, but again, you will adapt and recover. Comfort. These cans are extremely comfortable. Even for my large head. Ear cushions are comfy, as is the head cushion. Could it use more cushion? Maybe if you wear them for 8 hrs straight. Weight. Yes, they way a tad bit more than the competition, but, that is to be expected as the battery is slightly larger...hence why you can get up to 60hrs of life on these bad boys! The cans don't feel cheap, they feel solid. And that is something I can appreciate. Are these cans perfect? They are as close to perfect that you will get (IMHO) on Bluetooth headsets. Are there better cans out there? Sure, If you go wired, and spend a few hundred more, then yes. Even Sennheiser wired headsets (depending what model you get) are better, but that's because they are wired. Of course they will sound better.One thing I didn't discuss is noise canceling. They get the job done in fine fashion. I have tried the Sony 5s, and they are slightly better than the Senn 4s. I have made several phones calls, FaceTime calls and the voice activation works wonderfully! I am 7000+ miles away from home, and not one complaint on how I sound, or, how the other end sounds. Lastly, battery life. It claims you can get 60hrs of life once fully charged. That is a fact, as I have tested that claim and 59+ hours the first charge, not quite there for the second charge. Mind you, it will lose an hour or two depending on what you have activated.Accessories. Well, you can listen to these cans wired, especially if you run out of charge. You will need a dongle (I purchased one from Amazon) and they sound great. It will sound different, and you may need to adjust you equalizer. The case the cans come with is a solid, good quality case with charging type C cable, 3.5 wired jack, and an airplane adaptor to plug your cable into so you can listen to movies or music that the plane is playing. And it all is neatly stored within the case.Final thoughts:I honestly feel that alot of the issues that some people reviewed on Amazon is these headsets have ""buggy"" issues, or connectivity issues. Perhaps some just don't know how to do firmware updates, the phone they are using is dated? Not sure, all I know is mine cans fired right up, and I did the update straight away. These cans have Bluetooth 5.2, so it should be able to connect to any device that's out there currently. Yes, touch panel does take some getting used to. Much like driving a truck, then driving a sport car. It may take a moment to get familiar with the vehicle, but once you do, it's a piece of cake.I decided to take a chance, I did my research outside of Amazon reviews, and watched the pros on YouTube, and that's how I ended up buying these. Big risk considering I am a world away. Give em a try, you can always return them if they aren't for you.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AFGWGUIMRTG4L3M52MRY7QDFRDIQ,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R1FU9D18YOSOS6,"5.0 out of 5 stars Ignore the complaints, these are the best.",MA Stewart,5,"Let me say upfront I am a long-time audiophile. I've been immersed in all things high-end audio for more than 40 years, and listened to a lot of stuff, including headphones. Until recently, I've avoided all BT/wireless headphones because they presented too much compromise for my tastes. Noise cancellation adversely effected audio quality and/or gave me a headache. Bluetooth simply didn't cut it for prolonged enjoyment because of the lower, compressed resolution and frequency.But, that all changed in late 2022. On a whim, I tried the newish Sony WH-1000XM5 and was surprised at how good they sounded. The noise cancellation was excellent with little of the rushing elevator sound--and boy, the sound was terrific. For the first time I felt like using a wireless headphone wasn't a big step-down from wired. The M5's soundstage was truly impressive, rivaling my Focal Clear MG wired 'phones. Plus, the M5s were much lighter, more portable, and a bit more fun. The new Sony's were a magnitude better than the older Sonys, as well as anything wireless I'd heard before.That got me wondering: If the Sony's are this good, maybe something by Bowers and Wilkins or Sennheiser would be even better. After all, Sony caters to the mass market, which is generally not that discerning when it comes to audio. Whereas, B&W and Sennheiser typically aim more for the smaller, high-end, audiophile market. So, I started comparing the MX5 to the new B&W Px7 S2 and new Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless.Here's what I found:In the past, like the Sonys, the B&Ws and Sennheiser wireless 'phones were disappointments, falling far short (for me) of their wired, non-NC counterparts. No longer, because the new models are dramatically better. Without going into lots of detail (something audiophiles love to do), both the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 are a leap forward in every way than their predecessors. Are they better than the MX5, yes, but not by much. As others have said, the MX5 has better software, better NC, is very portable, and pretty comfortable. For many, the slight compromise in audio quality may not be a big deal. I could easily live with the MX5. However, my priority is sound quality since I seldom use NC, and, even if the software of the B&Ws and Sennheisers is only acceptable.Therefore, it came down to the Px7 S2 vs. Momentum 4 for me. The Px7 S2 is much nicer to look at, exuding high quality. The Momentum 4, not so much. In fact, they look like an MX5 knock-off with a few upscale touches. The software of both the Px7 S2 and Momentum 4 is mediocre at best, albeit functional.Now about the sound. The Px7 S2 sound really, really good. Bass, Midrange, Treble are all top notch, if not perfect. They're fun to listen to, with a wide soundstage and energetic dynamics. That said, they're tuned to emphasize the lower frequencies a bit too much for my tastes. At first, this makes music and voices more vibrant and robust, but, over time, it gets tiring, and you're realize what you're hearing isn't all that accurate. If I hadn't listened to the Momentum 4s, I probably would have been quite happy with the Px7 S2.But, I did listen to the Momentum 4. It edges out thePx7 S2 and MX5 with its overall excellent balance and accuracy. Nothing is exaggerated: voices, instruments, timbre, tone are all just right to my ears. Maybe not as exciting as the Px7 S2 upon first listen, but the Momentum 4s seduce you the more you use them. There's no need for lots of equalization, or fiddling to get the sound right; its all been done at the factory. Besides the accurate representation of voices and instruments, the Momentum 4s are monsters when it comes to soundstage. The placement of everything is wide, yet accurate. You can feel the space and air between different instruments, and where the singer is in the studio or stage. Layering and detail are pretty amazing considering these are bluetooth, closed-back 'phones. Sennheiser (Actually: Sonova, because Sennheiser sold their headphone division to this maker of hearing aids in 2021.) did their homework when it came to the Momentum 4. Plus, that 60 hours of battery life is icing on the cake.Let me say this in conclusion. You won't go wrong with any of these three headphones. They're all great. I preferred the Momentum 4 because it represents the overall most satisfying package for the money, but you might prefer the Px7 S2, or the MX5, more. One last word, regarding the buggy software of the Momentum 4: I found none. With the latest updates, Sennheiser/Sonova seems have fixed the issues of poor connectivity and consistency. All system functions worked perfectly the entire time I've been using the Momentum 4s. Enjoy!","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2023",AEZIPLEDJYRIGVJKWFWRH44LK4TQ,True,375,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R2CIT7PKP36F3M,"4.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional sound quality, great battery life. Noise cancellation is OK. Updates could make it 5/5.",Amazon Customer,4,"Sound quality on these is GREAT - No complaints whatsoever. Music sounds good, TV dialogue is easily understandable, full range of sound is audible. Mic quality is good, but not as top of the line as the sound.Battery life is pretty in line with what's advertised. Expect to charge at least twice weekly if you use your headphones heavily.I'm not crazy about the touch controls. They seem finicky to me, and don't give you good feedback. Instead of being able to adjust transparency on a percentage scale, I'd much rather have a quick switch for going between fully transparent and fully noise cancelling.I had some problems initially with pairing and set up. When connected to my Windows 10 PC, they appear as two different sound devices - Headphones & headset. Quality when connected as a headset is terrible, so make sure it's connected as headphones. Headset connection can be disabled in output devices if it's connecting the wrong one as default, but make sure it's left enabled in the input devices list or you won't be able to use the microphone.The app is...Not great. No desktop version as far as I can tell, so you have to control it from a phone or emulator. I ended up turning off almost all of the app features. Auto adjusting noise cancellation didn't seem to work properly, and I have no idea what ""Comfort calling"" is because most of the app features don't have descriptions (This one isn't listed in the manual either). On head detection has annoyed me with every device I've ever had it on, but I'll concede that before I turned it off this was the least terrible implementation that I've experienced.Initial pairing experience was troublesome, but now that all my devices (Desktop, laptop, phone) are paired I'm able to transition between them all pretty smoothly. Occasionally I'll have to turn bluetooth off on one device or another because I'll get continuous ""Connected/Disconnected"" messages while listening on a different device.Bottom line, if audio quality is your most important factor in looking for headphones, you'll probably be happy with these - I definitely am. That being said, they aren't the most user friendly headphones currently. I'm hoping that software/firmware updates might improve the experience, and I'll update this review if that happens.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2022",AGUYYNC6G5RGNFL4HD6LXEB6JJCA,True,31,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R1IVGTBWY7A3K4,"5.0 out of 5 stars First Sennheiser purchase, highly impressed!",Shara Simpson,5,"I obsessively researched before buying these Sennheiser Momentum 4s. I had it narrowed down to Bose QC Ultras, Sony WH-1000XM5s, or these. Ultimately it came down to sound quality for me. The quality and clarity of any music genre I tested it with was far and away superior to Sony or Bose. These don't have the absolute best ANC compared to those, but it's still top tier. If you are looking for a fully immersive, lost in the music type of experience with your headphones, Sennheiser is the way to go. And the battery life is absolutely insane! I've had these for 3 weeks with almost daily use (at least an hour a day but usually more) and I haven't had to charge them at all since the first initial charge - they are still sitting at 40%! Sennheiser says they should last 60 hours with ANC at half volume and that seems accurate. No other headphones come close to that kind of battery life. I really love the Sennheiser app as well, it's packed full of useful features. The EQ on these is fully adjustable using the app. I used the ""My Sound Check"" feature and created sound profiles for various genres of music and places of use, but you can also manually adjust the 5-band EQ. You can save each sound profile and even use the Sound Zone feature to have the headphones automatically switch to a different sound profile based on your location (ex. gym settings versus work settings). There is also a Bass Boost toggle if you want head pounding bass. I really like the two-tone look of these - I got them in white, but the headband is covered in a very nice textured tan fabric and the earcups are tan as well. They are extremely comfortable for hours of use at a time. The case is super sturdy and nice. I put a size comparison pic in this review with the case next to my Kindle - the case is large since the headphones don't fold. This makes them less than ideal for use when traveling because they do take up a lot of space in your bag. The first week of use, I did have connection issues. They would randomly disconnect from whatever music streaming service I was using at the time and I would have to reconnect. Thankfully that went away and I haven't had any further connectivity problems. I don't use these for phone calls so can't review the mic or call quality yet. Overall I think I made the right choice with these, and am extremely happy with my purchase. I would recommend to anyone!","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AFPBVELJBKTT3FYLFSJ7RHINHVFA,True,1,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R27AA754NCZRA9,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good on paper, bad on my head",Sam,3,"I was going back and forth between Sony WH-1000XM5 (XM5) and these headphones (SM4), and I decided to give these a shot since at the time of this purchase, I was able to get these for $279.83 before taxes while the XM5 are listed at ~$400 before taxes.On paper, the SM4 sounded great, double the battery life, supposedly better sound quality, and a not-so-shabby noise cancelling.However, after trying them for a week, I decided to return them. I will list the pros and cons below.PROS 1. Long battery life – I only charged it once during the whole week and it was still going strong. 2. Very solid construction – premium materials that feel good to the touch. 3. Pretty nice carrying case – feels solid and durable, and you don't need to fold the headphones when you put it in so it's simpler to stow in case. BUT I have to reset the positions of the earcups to fit into case, which means I have to always re-adjust to my head size before putting it on. 4. Great sound – I'm not an audiophile, but it sounded good. A friend said he picked up on more chords behind a Taylor Swift song that he hasn't heard before (he listens to Taylor Swift 24/7). 5. Sleek design – unlike the SM3, the SM4 has design that I like: minimalistic and modern.CONS 1. Subpar app-headphone interface – the app is glitchy, and I find myself wait around 10 seconds for the app to say ""connected"" to the headphones (even though the headphones are connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth); after which point, I can go in and change some settings. Also, I did have some stutters in the app that gave me an overall feel of unpolished. 2. Too heavy and too much clamping force – on paper, the weight and clamping force differs by 0.1-ish, but from trying out my friends' XM5s and my SM4, I feel a pretty noticeable difference in how hefty the headphones feel on my head. Simply put, SM4 feels tight on my head and XM5 feels like I can forget that I’m wearing them after a while—this is personal preference, but personally, SM4 felt less comfortable and a tad too heavy for long study sessions. 3. Headache-inducing noise cancelling – the noise cancel isn't as good as the XM5 indeed, but I think there is a bigger problem: the noise cancelling feels peculiarly headache-y. I have airpod pros, plus I have tried the XM5s, and I have to say, the SM4's noise cancelling is by far my least favorite. If I were to describe it, I would say it feels like the feeling I get from being on an airplane for 5+ hours with headphones on. All in all, I opted to have no noise cancelling on due to this uncomfortable feeling it gives me. 4. Touch control – the touch control is pretty responsive, but even if I touch the very edge of the earcups, it registers as a gesture, which gets annoying when I'm trying to adjust my headphones or taking them off for a second. After a few days, I almost wanted to turn them off. ALSO, XM5's cupping gesture to activate transparency mode is extremely desirable, especially since I'm a college student who finds myself studying with my friends a lot. AND the SM4 does not have a gesture to turn off noise cancelling; I have to either pinch in/out multiple times or go into the app and adjust the slider, and it gets very annoying quick.If you have read this far, I applaud your diligence to find the best headphones for you. Personally, I have ordered the XM5 and I will try it on and probably keep it. BUT, an advise for you if you are like me. I dug through the internet and have looked at countless written, video, and professional reviews of so many headphones, but I have to say, it all comes down to personal preference. You MUST go to a Best Buy, where they have headphones on racks that you can try on for yourself. Also, don’t be afraid to order them on amazon and try it out for a week and return them and move onto the next one. Amazon’s return policy is pretty good and if you use the headphones with care and keep the packaging that the headphones came in, you can most likely return them for free. I hope you find the right pair of headphones for yourself, reader.","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2023",AE4ZGTN75KVUPUK7VO5OXU4BKWJA,True,117,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R3C9NCI2LLQD48,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser vs Sony vs Apple,Calder Akin,5,"After watching countless hours of review videos and sampling multiple headphones firsthand I narrowed my final selections down to the Momentum 4’s ($280 currently on Amazon), and a pair of certified refurbished (eBay) AirPod Max’s ($390) and Sony Xm5’s ($280). My budget was under $400. I also considered the Bowers & wilkins px7 s2 but didn’t have a chance to try them out firsthand so I excluded them from my selection process.Ultimately I decided to go with the Sennheisers. To me the Sonys are the most comfortable (so light, it’s as if there’s nothing on your head!) but the ear-cup itself is the shallowest of the three- my ears stick out a little so this was a consideration. Also, I have an iPhone and many reviews said the audio was better on the XM5’s when connected to androids due to the Ldac etc. The Apples sound the best when it comes to immersive experience (spacial audio wow!) but the limited EQ flexibility, and the extra money I’d have to spend on a real case plus wires to plug into a jack when flying outweighed (no pun intended- but these things ARE heavy!) the luxury feel.The Momentum 4’s (M4) are very comfortable with plush faux leather on the ear cups. I wish they were a bit bigger of an oval shape (something to consider if you have big ears) but for me they fit just right. The ear cup has more substantial padding and recesses slightly deeper than the Sonys over the ear. All three of these headphones have the same sliding headband design which I really like.Where the M4’s really shine however is in the audio department. It just sounds so clean in my opinion. I own a pair of Beats Studio 3’s which are my go-to gym headphones. You don’t get a “pounding” heavy sound with the M4’s like you do with the Beats but that’s fine with me. They also don’t get as loud as my Beats but I didn’t buy them for either of these reasons. I wanted a pair of headphones for traveling, taking the dog for a walk, and listening to music/tv around the house. Speaking of watching TV with them, there’s an EQ preset through the app which is designed for podcasts. I set the headphones to this feature the other night while watching a basketball game and it sounded amazing! Also there’s this cool feature for phone calls which you can adjust through the app where it sounds like you aren’t wearing headphones and you can hear your own voice clearly - muffled sounding phone calls are a thing of the past!Overall I’m incredibly happy with my purchase. They aren’t quite as comfortable as the Sony’s- it’s not that they’re uncomfortable it’s just they have more weight to them and more of a clamp on the head. And they don’t have the seamless syncing ability and build quality of the Apples. Also, their noise cancelling and transparency mode is slightly below both. But for the price and sound quality these were the best fit for me.Pros:* price ($279 on Amazon currently which is around $70 below retail)* Clean, pure audio that sounds good regardless of your favorite genre of music.* Comfort- plush pads with ample space for my ears to be enclosed. Easily adjustable sliding headband.* Rigid case (slightly smaller than the XM5’s)* Battery life (60 hours!)* Auto-off feature when taken off and not used for 15 minutes or more depending on how you set it (great if you often forget to turn off your headphones!)* Easy to navigate app. I know some have complained about the app but I’ve had zero issues with it- maybe the firmware has been fixed with the most recent update?* No noticeable hissing sound with ANC.* 2 year manufacturers warranty* Usb-c and traditional 3.5mm connectivity. Also they come included with a two-prong airplane jack.Cons:* I appreciate the creativity making most of the functions of the headphones accessible via touchpad on the right ear-cup, but the pinching/expanding feature to adjust ANC/transparency is useless. Thankfully you can just double tap the headset to switch between these settings.* They don’t get super loud, well at least compared to my Beats, so I wouldn’t consider these a great gym option. (Edit: there’s a thread on Reddit that gives some pointers on how to increase the overall volume- especially if you have an iphone. Worth checking out, the adjustments I made did seem to work)* They aren’t water/sweat resistant, which is another reason not to wear them to the gym.* ANC is effective but not on the level of the Sonys or Apples.* The auto pause feature is pretty sensitive. Something to keep in mind if you adjust your headphones often during usage. If you lift them off your head, even to just change position the audio can unintentionally pause. (Edit: there’s a way to turn off this function in the app)TLDR; Best Bluetooth noise cancelling over ear headphones currently available.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2023",AGGIZAHMHFHO4J6OU7FMAHUD4MMA,True,154,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R38QYC50V9S55Y,5.0 out of 5 stars Winner of my search for headphones,Chip chipperson,5,"I wanted to find a really good set of over the ear headphones to use at the office and for general use. I tried a few other highly rated models at varying price points. The momentum 4 was the winner for me. I had been using Beats Studio noise canceling earbuds and before that a pair of beats special edition solos. The solos hurt my ears after 2 hours, while the earbuds were great, but they just don’t last long enough for my current work environment without having to charge. Additionally, the earbuds had bad sound wuality for the microphones so they weren’t ideal for phone and teams calls.I orders the sennheiser as my higher end option to evaluate. At first I was a little skeptical of they were going to be the ones. I found that just pairing them to my iPhone worked and was easy, but it did t allow me to use the sennheiser app. I cleared them from my phones Bluetooth lost and paired again using the app, and all was good. The app offers a pretty decent amount of customization and guides you through it. I think the app works well once you get it all configured correctly. There are other headphones on the market that will really rattle your head with bass such as the beats and some of the skullcandy headphones. I found that I don’t care for those headphones when I’m listening to podcasts or audiobooks, they are just too tuned for music with deep and solid bass. The momentum 4 delivers some very tight and punch bass. I can’t say I’m wow’d by the bass I get for every track I listen to, but when I get into a bass heavy track or album, I find myself completely wow’d by the performance and range of these momentum 4’s. I believe these are a truer representation of how most songs are actually recorded. The clarity, crisp, clean, tight, punchy, deep, and full sound from these headphones is fantastic. I think my podcasts sound great, music sounds awesome, across a very wide variety of genres. The clarity of my voice in a loud office setting to take phone calls and teams calls is great. The noise canceling is always on unless you adjust to transparency to some degree, and I would have expected this to hinder battery life, but these do a great job canceling ambient noise and fully live up to the claims of 60plus hours of use between charges.I wear these at a minimum 6 hours a day, sometimes as much as 10. They actually keep a connection far better than I expected. I have these paired to my work pc and my iPhone at the same time and can get up and move around our office and leave devices at my desk and never lose connection. While connected to two devices it does a good job seamlessly transitioning from one device to the other based on what apps or programs you are running.Last thing I can think to comment on are the headphone controls. The right earpiece is a touch sensitive pad that picks up on specific but very intuitive gestures. Pausing music, changing tracks, adjusting ANC and transparency, and volume is super easy. The only one of these I think is a little touchy is the volume control, which works fine but it seems a little inconsistent as to how much it adjusts each time. I’ve never had a situation where it was too sensitive and blasted me with sound unexpectedly.Overall, I do recommend these for the money. Like mine so well, I bought a pair for my wife as she was so impressed with mine as well.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2024",AEHRRPY3SLGEJSCWGWWY75QNAMUQ,True,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R3HDZ4YGKNQ6L5,3.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable + Great Sound + Connection Problems + Poor touch controls,Ryan,3,"I just got these headphone. I really like how they feel and sound. The problem I have with these headphones is largely related to its bluetooth features and controls. I have these headphones connected to my phone and my TV. I live in an apartment. As such, these headphones constantly get confused between which bluetooth source to connect to. The result is choppy, broken audio or no audio at all and problems with touch controls.When its my phone's audio that's choppy the solution is to disconnect the tv using the headphone app. However, shortly after disconnecting the tv, the tv reconnects on its own and the problem returns. When its the TV audio that choppy, I have to turn off bluetooth on my phone completely to solve the problem. This again is due to the headphones automatically connecting to the unwanted source.The controls for this headphone are wonky to say the least and often don't work. For example, I will answer a phone call with a touch control but then can't end the phone call with a touch control. Another example is that I can't start or resume playing Spotify on my phone using touch controls. But while the music is playing I can pause, skip, or change the volume. I think some of these problems may be due to the headphones connecting to my tv at the same time. I suspect that my attempts to play or resume music are being sent to my TV (which is off) and not to my phone.The headphone's app is largely useless for attempting to solve these problems. The likely solution to all of these problems is to 'forget' my tv. Meaning, everytime I want to connect my headphones to my tv I would have to pair them with my tv. At this point, I'm likely to return these headphones due to all of these problems.To put all of the above in perspective. I have a pair of Pixel earbuds and I experience none of the above problems.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AF4KKUJCDDGW4ZZLQN23QJMOYFCQ,True,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones,
R3CBBVTHO6OEW6,3.0 out of 5 stars I wanted to love these...,Joe,3,"I own another pair of Sennheiser headphones, the 598SE's, and they're spectacular. They're spacious, clear, wonderful sound stage, light, and powerful.After trying a few other brands of ANC headphones, I learned about the Momentum 4's and immediately thought: OK, Sennheiser is gonna knock it out of the park.Unfortunately, they only got to first base.First, the good:I love how these look, especially the copper accented special edition's that I got. The fabric on the top of the headband makes it look classy.The sound is wonderful. Absolutely the best thing about this product. The sound stage compared to the other major competitors is still a step above.The carrying case is nice, roughly the same size as their competitors. I did wish it could have been a bit smaller (this goes for the competitors too).The swipe controls are the same as a major competitor, which you can also lock. I really like the swipe controls, though having physical buttons would be nice too, especially if you lock the swipe controls.The battery life is beyond spectacular. It destroys their competition and you could probably wear these for several days without needing a charge.Now, the bad:They're quite heavy. The weight on paper seems like they'd be fine, but while wearing them I quickly got fatigued and felt frustrated wearing them (while their competitors, it took much longer to get to that point).They get hot. Not the headset itself, but they form a seal on your head and you'll feel your ears cooking after a short while in a comfortable temperature room. This was another reason I frequently took them off.The earcups are small. They seem EVER SO SLIGHTLY larger than their competitors but... not enough. The 598SE's have big beautiful spacious earcups but these (and their competitors) are very cramped.The ANC is notably weaker in a perfect environment without noise playing than others. With others, I could barely make out any words while playing a song or video rather loud as a test. With the Sennheisers I could make out quite a bit of words and sound. The Momentum 4's have fewer ANC microphones than the competitors.The ANC also almost drops out completely if you have ""windy environment mode"" turned on, for some reason. (Note: I did not test them in a windy environment) If the ANC is important, make sure you have this setting *TURNED OFF* in the app.The app is ok, but what you can ""control"" seems finicky and sometimes its as if changing settings did nothing.The call volume is like 5 generations ago hands-free headset. Very poor quality. The person I tested them with said it sounded like I was outdoors or in a noisy environment when I was in a quiet room.The clamping is quite tight and becomes painful very quickly. It puts a lot of pressure around your ear which can become very uncomfortable. A friend said they loosen up after a couple days but mine stayed far too tight. It felt like a vice. [If it doesnt bother you, this could be a plus, as they seem like they will hold their shape and tightness for a long time]Even lacking almost any physical buttons, they basically threaten you to not get these wet. There is no waterproofing on these. Handle with care.The rest:These are by no means a ""bad"" set of wireless ANC cans, and the price is good, especially if you can get them on sale. If you're just going to be using them in the office or on a commute, they'll probably be fine, especially if you dont want to dole out extra cash for a minor upgrade in ANC. The middling ANC was quite disappointing, but if you have some sounds playing while its on, it works together to make most noises disappear. Unfortunately, sometimes I want to be able to just block out the world, and the Momentum 4's were just not up to the task compared to others.I was really hoping the earcups would be larger and more similar to other Sennheiser headsets I've tried/owned, but they seemed to want to copy the competition, which is a shame. If the cups were larger and the clamping a bit less harsh, I would have accepted their flaws and gone with these. With the laundry list of negatives, you can probably tell why I didnt.Also please note: I am a big guy, and I probably have a larger than average head. This could be contributing to the clamping pressure.Listening to anything on these was a treat. Everything sounded beautiful. Other brands should take a few notes on Sennheisers drivers.I had two main requirements: comfortable ear cups (failed) and long battery life for an upcoming flight (wow did these pass with not flying colors but to outerspace and back colors!). Unfortunately, as they were just not at all comfortable (I could wear my 598SE's for days and not even realize they're there). Their long battery life did not offset the negatives.This may all not be true for you. They definitely stand out and are far more attractive than the competition (at least, the special edition versions are). I am definitely biased towards Sennheiser as I have loved so many of their headsets, but found these disappointing in far too many areas. A few design tweaks could have made these one of the best over the ear cans on the market. As is, they're probably ranked 4th imho.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AHECMYUWUWYVG4EVIGA4QI6LUO4A,True,6,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones,

Safe to say, they aren't the most noise canceling headphones you can get. So when I went looking for a new pair of wireless over-ears, I had a lot to choose from. I didn’t want sony so that was out of the question.I had whittled it down to four pairs.AirPods MaxBose Quietcomfort UltraSennheiser Momentum 4’s andSonos Ace.Now each of these had their own strengths and weaknesses.AirPods Max are realistically only compatible with apple products and have the worst battery life. However have the same sound signature as my current AirPods.Bose Quietcomfort Ultra has the best noise canceling of the bunch, but was more expensive and ultimately poor battery life.Sonos Ace is the newest one of the bunch, it has decent audio quality and an okay battery. The worst was the microphone, I did not want to have to deal with a microphone that low quality.Which brings me to the ones I went with.Momentum 4 has some of the best soundstage I’ve heard in headphones. The bass is punchy but doesn’t muddy the rest of the track. The touch controls are personally a hit or miss, I love most of them but wish I could pinch or un-pinch to turn transparency fully on or off respectively. I haven’t charged them but once, and they currently have 70% after two days of use.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHMM6BNJ762VVIBOWD4MVGAQWYVA,True,0,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R1RV286N7J32C4,4.0 out of 5 stars Sound quality is top notch. ANC is much better than my old Sony. Battery lasts forever.,B. Carter,4,"My daily drivers at home are open ear Hifiman. I don't think any bluetooth ANC headphones will ever match that experience, but Sennheiser comes closer than any I've yet heard. It meets my needs.The noise cancellation is much stronger than my old $120 Sony headphones, and the battery lasts roughly three times as long -- upwards of 60 hours. The audio pass-through feature is also great for those times when you need to listen to your surroundings.I enjoy the style as well. The white/beige color stands out among bluetooth headphones, I think.I've only two complaints: 1) My head is on the larger size, and these are a tight fit. They do break in after awhile (I'm posting this after around 9 months of use), but they still clamp a bit too hard for my liking, and can run hot. Should not be a problem for most people, I think. But for larger headed folks, be aware of what you're getting into. I'm willing to make the compromise for headphones of this quality, though. 2) the headphones have the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously, but I find this feature isn't worthwhile. When I'm listening to music through my tablet, and I get a text alert from my phone, there's a staticky sound that just makes it not worth using. That said, I haven't had the other software issues that some users experience. As far as I can tell, Sennheiser has patched it all up -- my experience has been smooth.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AH2PJ2BKE72VH5SVUL7TI6ZMXXXA,True,1,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

The picture shows comparison with sony 720n. I tried Sony ULT wear (too bassy), Beats Pro (too flat sound signature), Sennheiser Accentum (good but sound quality wasnt best), Sony WH 1000 XM4 (instrument separation wasnt bes). I have Airpods pro 2 but I also wanted a headset as the sound staging of headset is better.Let me address all the cons that you might have heard from youtube influencers. All the cons like headset automatically powering on while in case, auto pause not working etc are gone with latest software update (Software rev 2.13.28)Pros:The sound of Sennheiser momentum 4 is clean with impressive instrument separation and bass that both hits and resonates. The sound staging is shockingly well. For some tracks, it feels they are being played live in front of me. The sound is loud enough for me. I keep them around 70% as I dont want to miss out on all of that intstrument separation!the case, although bigger than sony ULT wear/1000xm4 and bose QC but its not as big as sony 1000 xm5 or other headset that dont fold. Refer to the pic. Because of impressive sound, I am willing to compromise a little on the case size.Impressive ANC. The world goes super quite. I cant hear my keystrokes when I am typing, no hum of AC in the background (my home office is very close to AC unit). Touch controls are bit sensitive but its not bad. You get used to it.I purchased them at $280. So its a steal. I would not buy them at $379. They dont feel premium enough to justify $379 price tag. They do live up to $280 price tag. Not super premium, but not cheap looking by any means.60 hours battery life!The clamping force isnt as tight as its on other Sennheiser headsets like 450 BT or Accentum. Its bit tighter as compared to Sony WH 720 n though. The earcups do seems to get a little hot after a while and I have to let heat out and adjust them a little.Cons:Not perfect for travel due to big case. But I still manage.Def less comfortable than my sony wh720nIf they go on sale for $279 or lower, get them!

R246JYYUL9YOYE,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing battery life, sound quality, and ANC.",Joseph Oscar,4,"I've figured out the bug people seem to run into which is the headset does not output sound. They're onand connected but no music. In my case, it's when an app. is activated for VOIP. I'm currently using the Nextiva phone app to answer calls when I walk away from the desk and when I receive a phone call, I have to force close the app to get music rolling again. Once music is playing, I can open the app again to catch the next call. It's a buggy back and forth but I have it figured out at least. Current phone is Google Pixel 7 Pro. So if anyone else reads this, try force closing whatever secondary app you use for VOIP.I just wanted the main issue to be the first eye catcher but with the headphones working and the equalizer set from the app, these things rock. If I'm working on a car with the ANC turned on, I can barely hear the air compressor running in the background. A little but it's reduced significantly. Now the ear cup material will make you sweat if your in a warm environment so make sure your aware of that. It's not that bad really. I'm sure when it gets warmer out, it will be more noticable. Probably not a good workout headphone either. That I can't comment on. I have to many excuses to go to the gym 😅.Battery life is great. Rated 60+ hours and it definitely is there. I use my headset daily with ANC moving all over the place with whatever I'm doing and music running all kinds of volume levels. I definitely don't charge these very often but get over a week depending on usage. 4-8 hours a day thoughout the work week.Sometimes, the in ear sensor that tells when the headset is on will think I've removed the headset and turn off. I'll just have to push the right side head cup in and it will read again and turn back on. Kind of annoying but I think I need to reach out to Sennheiser about that.Fingure controls, super easy and very responsive. Once you've used the headphones a few times and read the instruction sticker that comes on the headphones, it's muscle memory from there. Your off doing your own thing swiping, pinching and pressing your fingers around using the functions.

RL3M28E80KTYV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality, solid in every other area",Aaron,5,"Bought these along with the Sony XM5 to compare to my existing Bose 700.Comfort:The Bose 700 I don't find very comfortable, namely the headband, being rather thin, it puts pressure on the top of my head after a couple hours. The Sony had this problem initially, but then I started loosening the headband as much as possible, and being a very light pair, I stopped having that particular issue. All in all I found the Sony much more comfortable than the 700. I could see some folks saying it's more comfortable than the Momentum 4s. However I disagree about that. For me the Momentum 4 are the most comfortable. It has very soft ear pads, much like the Sony. Granted the M4s are heavier, but the weight is distributed very well across the headband, better than the Sony's imo. All in all, it's a close call and the Sony's are really well done comfort wise. Super light and super cushy pads. Could see a reasonable person going in either direction for the win here.Sound quality:I think the XM5 are pretty close to the Bose 700 and could see folks going either way depending on your signature preferences. Personally think I like the Sony a bit better, just more lively than the more neutral Bose. Both are in the same league though. The M4s are way better sound quality wise plain and simple. They're not in the same league. Heck, they're not even playing in the same sport. Find myself listening to music way more often during the day simply because I enjoy it that much more. This is the reason I'm ultimately sticking with the M4s. And it's not a hard decision.Noise cancelation:Sony XM5 are simply the best. If you're buying headphones to block out the sound of your partner playing annoying tiktok vids, this is the one to get. M4s have pretty good noise canceling too, but the Sony's are way better here imo. Bose sits between the XM5 and the M4s, maybe just a little better than the M4sMic sound quality:I'm work remotely with multiple meetings throughout the day so I've done extensive testing on all three models. In a nutshell if you don't have any special requirements, all of them do a great job. In quiet conditions I prefer the the M4 a little better than the others, my voice just has more body to it, but again, it's plenty clear using any of these models. In noisy conditions, the Sony XM5 are way better than the rest in isolating your voice and minimizing background noise. Simply incredible! The 700 and M4 handled the background noise a bit differently. My voice is clearer on the M4s in noisy conditions whereas the Bose cancel out more background noise at the cost of sacrificing clarity. When there's lots of noise, the Bose can reduce your voice to the point where it's super difficult to hear what you're saying. The M4s will allow more background noise through, but my voice remains super clear and louder than other sounds coming through.One feature I really like about the M4s, the one and only button they have (making it super easy to find) becomes a mute button during calls, zoom or google meetings. Really enjoy that feature as I could walk around the house and unmute myself if I need to talk. A voice tells you if it's muted or unmuted so you know where you're at. No more flushing the toilet while running out of the room hoping no-one on the meeting heard it.The background noise canceling of the XM5 during calls was so good, it made me really want to keep them. But ultimately good music sound quality is something I'd enjoy more often since I'm not often taking meetings in super noisy conditions. Also the M4s have the mute button I could use if I do find myself in that situation.Summery:If you want incredible noise cancelation while listening to music, taking calls or meetings, the Sony XM5 are the one to get. They are head and shoulders above the competition in this respect. If you wanna be wowed by how amazing your music sounds, renewing your love for music you didn't even know you had, the M4s are for you. These are the main areas where there is substantial difference. Sony and Seinheiser truly impressed me in their respective areas of expertise. Aside from those standout areas, these are all great headsets. Even the Bose 700 is a really solid headset. Unfortunately it wasn't able to differentiate itself when compared to these two titans of industry. Noise canceling is great, just can't touch the Sony's. Sound quality also great, just can't touch the M4s. Arguable the Bose are the slickest looking headset of the bunch though.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AEIK33PCH7JB7R3OI4CZJZPPNLDQ,True,88,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

RQIJ8796C2B2A,4.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser Sound is top notch,NerdyCup,4,"TLDR; great sound with pretty good ANC.First, I'm not an audiophile. I appreciate music and sound more than just ""MOAR BASS"" but as to warmth, tonality, and terms like that, I'm lost. I do know having worn open back headphones those have a great sound space compared to closed back, but my wife can't stand hearing my music so it's closed back headphones for me.Positive:1. Great sound. Between these, some Senns 598s, true momentum earbuds, I've never not liked the sound Sennheiser produces. Earbuds were the weakest, but those were Momentum 2s and didn't last long when my dogs chewed on them (I understand Sennheiser has improved as well).1A. I cannot understate how good these sound - I literally can hear Chester Bennington pushing his breath out on ""Lost"", and instruments I've never picked up before. I can't recall other headsets doing that for me.2. Comfortable - immediately comfortable out of the box. Maybe warms up my ears a bit much, but the benefit is a solidly closed ""box"" for my ears to listen without distraction.3. Battery life appears to be as epic as they say it is. I haven't rocked it solid for 50+ hours to find out but I've charged it like once, when I first got it a few weeks ago (not constantly listening)Unknowns: need to test the ANC on an airplane/airport setting, which is my biggest pet peeve for noise environments. Will try to update (if I remember) once I do.Negatives:1. Touch controls in general. It's not just Sennheiser, but Sony and others im sure. I just don't really want to take the time to remember if it's a swipe, pinch, double-triple-quad tap to do something. KISS should be the rule of thumb. I can stumble through by tapping/swiping either side and eventually find something close to what I want, but I usually end up in the Sennheiser Smart Control App to make sure the ANC is what I want.Comparison:I also got a Sony WH-1000XM5 recently. Also a very good headphone, but the sound is absolutely not as good as Sennheiser. ANC is top of class though (although I also have t tried it in an airport/airplane, just in my commutes), and is better than Sennheiser, it's not as huge a gap as it used to be. We're comparing a Porsche and a BMW; should anyone turn either of them down? No.It comes down to your personal needs: lots of travel(air, train, whatever) in noisy environments? Maybe go with Sony, but I'd try the Sennheiser Momentum 4s first to see if their ANC works for you. IMO, the Sennheiser sound quality is much better than Sony's sound more than Sony's ANC is better than Sennheiser's.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AGX5BT3OBJ4RMSQM7TVVOBQTPU4Q,True,4,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones,

R3V8FW19HBYSG7,3.0 out of 5 stars Don't touch them or they'll try to connect to everything,Customer Since 1997,3,"These headphones must have some kind of tilt sensor or other mechanism to know when they have been moved. If I am not using them and I accidentally touch them or they get bumped and move even slightly, they will suddenly try to connect to every device they are paired with, cutting off the sound from a random device I'm not currently using them with. They also seem to just randomly connect themselves to any device that is playing audio, cutting off the sound so that I have to go to that Bluetooth device's settings and disconnect them to get sound back. Very annoying.That aside, these are what I would call 'average' headphones. They're your typical V-shaped consumer sound that you'd get from any other dynamic headphone. They're bass heavy because your average consumer equates more base with more quality.Their noise cancellation is not particularly good. They seem to slightly lower the volume of some noises. In the areas where other noise canceling headphones excel such as repetitive or droning noises, these headphones seem to not work at all. For example, when I'm a passenger in a car I can clearly hear the noise of the air conditioner with the noise cancellation maxed out.There's also a problem with the touch surface on the earcup. I have turned off the touch features several times but they keep turning themselves back on. Every time I touch my face to scratch an itch or brush my hair out of my face I hear a PLOK and a random setting on the headphones has changed itself as if I have interacted with them. I have to dig my phone out in the middle of my exercise, figure out which setting was changed, and change it back.That's not to say that these headphones are all bad: I have tried many of the headphones in the ""fancy wireless headphones with noise canceling"" category over the years, and I'd have to say that in terms of comfort, these are the best. I can wear them for hours while exercising with minimal discomfort.That said, they do have some rattling and creaking issues that I would not expect at this price point. There's an unusual amount of plastic material on these headphones that I would not expect on a premium noise canceling headphone. While other brands are using lovely brushed aluminum supports for the earcups, these headphones have stuck with the creaky plastic with clearly visible mold lines.To summarize, I would say that these headphones are sort of the odd person out: They do not excel at anything, but they are not particularly bad at anything, either. Senheiser seems to have targeted to produce a headphone that provides middle-of-the-road performance in all areas, and in that capacity they have succeeded.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AER3H6YXKFEFRVUVRRMSWOQFE42A,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R3SEN7P7M4VZGU,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good, but few issues",David,4,"Overall I like the headphones, they sound good to me, the fit is fairly comfortable, build quality is good, the ANC is fine, and the battery lasts a long time.I just have a few complaints. Firstly, the connection gets choppy sometimes, and I don't know why. It often requires restarting the headset to fix. Another issue is that the quietest volume is not quiet enough. Listening to music in bed at night, it's just too loud in such an otherwise quiet environment. Also the auto-off/wake feature is way too sensitive. I'll leave it on my desk, come back later, and just bumping the desk makes it turn back on which often I don't want. Also if I manually disconnect the headset BT connection from my phone, the headset will just reconnect after a few seconds which is really annoying.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AEL3ADX56NWIHHUCZKWI7N6FDU5Q,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R2U81MBUB3SIOG,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser Momentum 4 vs. everything else,AC,5,"Note:I am a trained listener - first as a former musician, second as an engineer, and lastly as a military operator.Devices used for testing/review:Samsung S22 Ultra (*disclaimer: Samsung owns Harman/AKG/etc., so their audio software is well above average)iPhone 12 Pro MaxApple Airpods MaxDragonfly Cobalt + USB C connector (for the wired headphones)Grado RS2eBeyerdynamic T1 v2Random air purifier on maxMusic tested:Houkiboshi by Younha (vocal, piano, guitar J-Pop song/anime soundtrack)Flash by Rocket Punch (standard K-Pop song)The The by Rocket Punch (dance K-Pop song)Wow by DIA ('new-retro' K-Pop song)Design overview:1. I purposely bought the white model - very clean/modern look, but perhaps a little too minimalistic. Also looks like many other competing wireless headphones ><.2. A little on the small side. I have fairly average-sized ears, and the earcups barely cover the lobes, which is great for passive noise cancellation, but I did have to adjust the headband quite a bit. In comparison, the Airpods have a self-adjusting system similar to my wired AKG K712 i.e., the headband will adjust to your head size.3. Plasticky compared to the Apple's metal frame. It's kind of like my AKG vs. my Beyerdynamic. In terms of build quality feel, 'you get what you pay for'.Comfort:1. Earpads: this is what most travelers will care about. Like with any headphone, I adamantly recommend everyone review manufacturer site, legitimate review sites, etc. The Sennheiser M4 has pleather pads as you can tell. No need to say that they'll get hot after a while - common knowledge. Grado loses here for obvious reasons, then the Sennheiser, then the Beyerdynamic, and finally the winner the Airpods. Apple was smart in using mesh - breathable and lightweight.2. Headband: this is not as big a deal as earpads. None of the test headphones were terrible, but some were still better than others. The Sennheiser uses a medium with pleather band covered by fabric, which looks nice. In a huge switcheroo, Grado wins with their thin industrial band, followed by Apple's thin metal, then the Sennheiser, and finally the Beyerdynamic with their high-end but a little too thick leather curve.Sound and Noise cancellation:1. Obviously, a wired headphone connected to a top end USB DAC will beat any wireless one, but both the Apple and Sennheiser did well here. And they still cost less than the Beyerdynamic to boot.2. Neither wired headphones are noise cancelling nor do they claim to be, but being semi-closed/open, you would think the Beyerdynamic might do ok, but no joy.3. Both the Apple and Sennheiser are very good at noise cancellation, but not perfect, but the Apple was clearly better, even with all Sennheiser settings at max.Accessories:1. This is a fun one. Apple being Apple, gives you jack (no pun intended). An USB C to Lightning cable, infamous bra case.2. Sennheiser, meanwhile, gives you an outdated (haven't seen these in years) airplane double connector, 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable, USB C to A cable, and finally a nice cloth case (my color combo was gray).3. Additional note: wired headphones, being wired, both the Grado and Beyerdynamic gave 3.5mm to 6.3mm audio adapters. Being a high-end model, the T1 also came with a case.Final thoughts:1. I normally don't use wireless headphones, at most, a Bluetooth amp, the aforementioned USB DAC and one of my usual wired cans. But my brother convinced my to try a pair for an upcoming trip. They really are convenient.2. The unfortunate thing I found in my search, as of this writing (9/30/2022), there are no modern (i.e., BT 5) really high-end e.g., T1 level wireless headphones out there. They all seem to top out around the $400 mark, which sounds a lot, but not for a ultra high end wired headphone.3. Of the 10 or so better choices out there, what I would recommend depends on your music style, phone, use/need. Loyal Apple users - Airpods Max, Android users - this Sennheiser M4, hardcore must have the best music quality users - wait - niche uber manufacturers are getting there.","Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2022",AFZQEWUCJEY5NLQE6XQY3QQ5WC3Q,True,36,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R15B34B8ZDY89M,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and battery life with a couple comprimises,Grant Bohn,5,"If your priority is sound quality and battery life, these are the headphones to get. I listen primarily to electronic music and the bass is just right. It's clear and full, but not overbearing once EQ'd down a couple dB in the app. What you give up for this is comfort and ANC quality. These are not the sort of headphones you forget that you're wearing. They definitely have some heft to them and a higher clamping force than others. They do feel solidly built though. The ANC works well but from other reviews I've read, it falls a bit short compared to Bose and Sony's offerings. It's a give and take, but the momentum's deliver on fantastic sound and industry leading battery life if that's what you're looking for.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AGE7TIJAE6AOGRW2PLXE2CTUAV3Q,True,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R15H50LMG3BLPJ,5.0 out of 5 stars The premium headset to get,tlking4,5,"I've been looking to replace my Plantronics V8200 for years; I travel for work, take calls on both desktop and mobile, need a good microphone, often need solid noise cancellation, value comfort, and need convivence in charging, portability, and connectivity. The Momentum 4 checks all the boxes.Battery life is insane. Once charging cord (finally) is great. ANC is solid; no uncomfortable pressure or buzzing; and I took a flight while barely realizing we were on one.The folding and durability is nice and can easily carry these in a backpack with many other items. Extremely comfortable even for an 8hr session (and I wear glasses).I am far from an audiophile, but I have zero complaints about sound quality for calls, music, games, and movies. The in-app EQ is a good option. Mic quality is solid and have received zero complaints even on external customer calls.I was not expecting to like the touch controls. I do wish they were physical buttons, customizable, and on both earcups instead of just the right hand one. However, the actual experience (swipe up/down for volume, left/right for tracks, and tap to pause) is solid, with very few accidently presses. On-head detection worked perfectly. The physical button on the headset being a mute button while on a call is amazing, and this is detected in software on mobile (example being discord) and on desktop (WebEx mutes and unmutes itself in software when I press the button on the headset). This is amazing.The Multipoint connection (android phone and windows laptop) is very solid; notifications on the phone don't steal audio from a work call or vice versa. I do wish the headphone jack was a normal 3.5mm one instead of a smaller plug on the headset, then I wouldn't have to keep track of the adapter cord. Minor issue; very glad there is still a physical cable option along with the USB-C charging.Overall, this was the headset I was looking for and expect to run it for years.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2024",AHXNPP7TG2E73FWLT7L7PDVSH4XA,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

R3IPWB05P9IKRT,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best All Over Ear Headphones,Customer Ed,5,"I’ve tried many over ear and in ear headphones, including the Sony WH-1000xm4 and xm5, apple AirPods Max, and other Sennheisers. Simply put, these are the best. These have enhanced my enthusiasm for listening to new music, and I love listening to old favorites with all the luxurious, crisp detail these headphones can reproduce. I’ve broken it down into the most important features to me:Sound Quality: I’m not audiophile, but I can say these sound far superior to any of the other over ears I’ve used. Sennheiser is known for its neutral, accurate sound, and these seem to be the best iteration of that sound. Soundstage is wide open with incredible spatial effects, instrument separation, and no notable coloration or boxy sound. Despite the clarity, the bass here is incredible. You can feel it, but in a natural way that really underpins the song. Strong, natural base and incredibly detailed throughout the frequency spectrum, I can’t wait to get these things on my ears all day long. Just a pure joy of a listening experience.ANC - very strong. Not quite as strong as the Sony, but not enough of a drop down. You won’t notice much of a difference between these and any of the “better” ANC headphones. Same goes for the transparency mode, which allows you to hear ambient noise when you switch it on.Battery life - 60 hours is insane, but in my experience I’m getting that with ANC on so the claims don’t seem to be exaggerated.Comfort: definitely a little heavier than my Sonys, but buttery smooth headband and even weight distribution make for comfortable, long listening sessions. May be a bit of adjustment period if you’re used to lighter cans, but certainly not as heavy as the AirPods Max.Touch controls: definitely take some getting used to at first. Double tap right ear cup to enable ANC or transparency, pinch in or out to change noise cancellation level (this control is wonky and very hard to use, so I just use adaptive ANC and let it do its thing). Tracks can be switched by swiping left or right, but this can be an adventure. Depending on the angle that they’re sitting on your head, it can be hard to swipe in the exact right direction. With some practice it gets better. Same goes for up and down for volume, and volume changes seem to occur depending on the length of your swipe, rather than in steady increments. This means getting it to your exact desired volume using touch controls can be difficult. Answering and ending calls is also done through swiping forward and back, so you can experience the same issues. Overall, not the most intuitive controls, but not a deal breaker and with time it becomes easier.Call quality: I keep these on while working and take phone calls. Through some testing, these provide much better voice pickup and clarity than any of my in ears or even the built in speaker phone. If I’ve got an important call, I know the person on the other line will hear every word if I’m using these. Switching between calls, music, and podcasts with these all day long, these are perfect. They also have multipoint connectivity, providing seamless switching between laptop and phone.Overall, these are the best over ears I’ve found for what I use them for. Music, podcasts, commuting, movies and tv shows, work calls. The highest praise I have for these is they have revived my love of music as they remind you how good music can sound when reproduced with clarity and detail.If you’ve got some deep pockets, I’d also pick up the Momentum true wireless 3 earbuds, to have that same beautiful sound during those times that full over ear headphones aren’t appropriate.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2022",AGORAFANRG5DE6BQM4JS3ZO3EAQA,True,47,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

R1UEJPGVRZ9X65,"5.0 out of 5 stars Smaller cups than other Sennheiser - amazing anyway, read full review",George Fields,5,"You're a smart person, you can find the frequency response curves, ANC curves, etc. online. This review is about the overall experience. Note: I happen to LOVE the way these look, simple, plain, understated... smaller target for theft, too.I have the Sennheiser HD 515, HD 598, and HD 598 Cs, and the Sennheiser GAME ONE headset. Those (and most other from the brand) have large, extremely comfortable ear cups. I know that, and need that, because I used to play World of Warcraft for about 50 hours a week, with headphones all the time.First impression—the cups are smaller. It just so happens that I have normal ears, and the other Sennheisers I have are too big for me, with a good margin to adjust them when the skin gets tired around my earlobes. The MOMENTUM 4 surprised me by being smaller, but—they have a really good design and are concave, with more space inside the cup than it seems, especially in the back. I am able to find a few different positions where my earlobes are not pressed (or even touched) at all, but how they fit you will depend on your ears, which is something important to consider.The review at SoundGuys is on point. The M4 do have a bit more low end than my other sets, and I like that; it's easier to EQ your way down than up. Overall very happy with the sound, I don't think you'd be disappointed. As the SG review says, the ANC is a little weak sometimes; I don't care, to me that's secondary.Battery life is amazing, the 60hrs claim seems accurate. Build quality is plasticky and okay, I would baby them a bit. Touch controls are precise and responsive for me, even with the guide stickers still on the outside (which I've removed after my wife made fun of me for it). The app seems to work all right, I think it's better to set your preferences and then not use it anymore, as sometimes the settings get changed around a bit for no reason. (KEEP UP WITH FIRMWARE UPDATES, though.)Connectivity—outstanding. Bluetooth (multipoint x2), passive mode, and USB mode. Quickly: * Bluetooth: works fine. Good range, it seems. I don't care for or like the multipoint, and I think it's irrelevant. * USB mode: use USB-A to USB Type C cable (included). Headphone presents as a regular USB headset to the computer. Works great and charges at the same time. * Passive mode: Uses a 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable (included) to use as a plain Jane wired headset. You CAN power on the M4 in this mode and benefit from better sound, or leave them off (on purpose, or if the battery is dead). I DISAGREE THAT THE SOUND IS BAD IN PURE PASSIVE MODE, WITH POWER OFF. It's slightly subpar compared to BT/USB/powered passive, but it's JUST FINE, and pretty good to boot.The SG review docks the M4 on mic quality, but in my tests people's feedback was that the calls were clear and noise-free, even when I was doing yard work on a very windy day. Still, YMMV.Case—it's a carrying case. It's... functional, plain, the way I like my coffee.My only complaint, if this tells you anything—the charge port and 2.5mm port are on the RIGHT cup, whereas all other sets I've ever had or seen have the cable going to the LEFT one. The power button and touch controls are also on the RIGHT, so maybe that's why, but on the (infrequent) occasions when you may have a cable attached, it's not where you'd be used to finding it.","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2023",AGORTA25R56MRPEW236JMI3XD25Q,True,111,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R11QF4OKPIM01C,3.0 out of 5 stars Wait For The Next Version,J.C.,3,"The ANC was incredible, the battery life was amazing, everyone could hear my voice on calls, they were comfortable, connected over Bluetooth, USB-C, or 3.5mm for audio (with one mini end, which was kind of silly), and they came with a nice case.The construction felt decent enough to me, although, it is definitely not the metal build many come to expect from Sennheiser.Audio quality was a little muddy in my opinion, using it mostly to listen to synthwave music and watching Dolby ATMOS content via PLEX. The app certainly didn't let me dial things in, which may have been why things didn't sound amazing. Overall, it was just okay.So, what's not great? The app on Android is awful, the headphones would sometimes cut out to a loud static, or pick up RF interference, and the touch controls are awful and easily activated by tilting your head. Also, there's no ""Lossless"" option for hi-res audio and you need a separate dongle to use on your PC (and still can't use it as a gaming headset without it stepping down to AM radio quality I/O).Once the new Bluetooth codec standards for lossless 16-bit / 44.1kHz come out, and once you can pair to networks and some of the new protocols coming out in the next few years, I would be curious to see if Sennheiser revises this and fixes the issues I've mentioned.It's very close, but it's just not worth the asking price. Maybe on a sale, or if you're okay with being limited by the codecs available.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AGX4NRDWLOEZF64P7JCMFL3CU5IQ,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R2DR9OKGN9HSJV,3.0 out of 5 stars Wired Mode is sometimes totally bugged. Manufacturer defect.,Amazon Customer,3,"I got this pair about a month ago, and when i got it out of the box to explore the features, I noticed some serious issues; the bluetooth latency is terrible for gaming, and in wired mode (to reduce latency), sometimes the sound is ruined.I'm a gamer, and I like to play a lot of PUBG, so I need great sound, AND I need low sound latency, I noticed that in bluetooth mode, the latency is just too high. Like ~100 ms high. Maybe this can be improved to like 40 ms with the right bluetooth controller, but I really want ~5 ms.When I first got it, and I tried to use wired mode (and stumbled upon the 2.5mm jack, had to buy new cables. Wtf is wrong with you. >:C), the sound quality was trashed. I don't mean ""bad"" like some picky audiophile. I mean TRASHED. I can hardly describe how bad it is, it's like the volume is dropped by 30 db, and for some reason only a few narrow bands of frequency manage to make it through, making some noises come through orders of magnitude louder than others. It's just this unlistenable murky mess. No exaggerationThis problem persisted for like 3 days, and it all of a sudden went away for no reason. It worked just fine for a whole month, (and I adored the sound quality) and now the problem has come back for no reason. What the hell is this? I noticed that if I back out the jack on my DAC by ~1/16 inch, I get decent sound quality IN MONO. Unacceptable. Factory resetting the headphones did nothing. A firmware update did nothing. Restarting my computer? nothing. Shutting off all bluetooth? Nothing.The other features are fine. Maybe I felt like the bass was comparatively weak to my old bassy cans, but I got used to it.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2024",AGGGNM37DWTLZE7UPYKWPFJCCBCQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
ROYKDE0H8KYE6,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite wireless headphones,mariah kemmerer,5,"You can use them while charging - all other arguments are obsolete.Lol but no seriously, not only do these have a crazy long battery life you can also use them while they are plugged in charging. I'm a simple woman with simple needs, but even the Sony M5 can't do that.I had been debating between these and the Sony 1000XM5 and had even purchased the M5. But I had to immediately return them. I'm not sure what it is with Sony and their terrible sizing. They were just too big and loose. Thankfully, Sennheiser has never disappointed and the fit of the Momentum 4 is great. As a general consumer (not a self-proclaimed audiophile) I found these very comparable in build and material to the Sony M5.Coming from always wearing open-back Sennheisers there is a drop in sound quality, but (!) that is expected and I don't find that a detractor. They still sound great. I think the Sony M5 had a bit more of a clearer sound, and the Momentum 4 has a bit too much bass out of the box - but with a little tweaking in the Sennheiser app, I found a happy spot. Noise-canceling is good - I wouldn't say top of its class, but I haven't found myself ever thinking ""gee, I wish they blocked out more noise."" And once I turn on music or a video I don't notice any background noise even in busy places.The mic is okay. I don't really use it, so it's not on my priority list - but if it is for you the Sony M5 outclasses these by a mile on mic quality.The Bluetooth connection works well for me and has a good range. But there can be some drawbacks if you're switching between more than 2 devices regularly. Between my iPad and iPhone, these headphones connect great, and audio will bounce back and forth between them pretty seamlessly. When only 2 devices are connected, they will always be connected and you don't have to do anything to switch between them. BUT once you add a third device you have to start regularly opening the app. You MUST have the app. Because I connected my iPad and phone first, after the headphones get turned on it will auto-connect to those 2 devices (regardless of what it was last connected to). When I first connected these headphones to my computer I couldn't understand why there was no audio and the sound settings were stuck on mute. Fun fact - you have to go into the app and open up the connection manager and toggle on the device you want to use. Only two devices can be toggled on at once. I have to do this every time I want to use these with my computer - because as I said it will revert to my iPad and phone automatically. Not a dealbreaker - but a pain in the ass.Touch controls. I don't hate them. I had a pair of older Bluetooth Sony's with touch controls and absolutely hated them. Bane of my existance. But I find these controls a lot better thought out and executed. I don't accidentally hit them and once I fiddled with the control options in the app (you can customize what some touches do) I really like being able to double-tap between ambient and noise canceling.Overall I really like these headphones and am very happy I returned the Sony M5 and grabbed these.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2022",AHMZTM2ZRR7O2HALQIPM7OE2UQUA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

The headphones are comfortable to wear all day and I don't notice any problems with the clamping pressure or the weight of the headphones sitting on top of my head. The sound quality is great, if you take some time to fine tune the EQ settings. They are also aesthetically pleasing for what it's worth.Most of the problems seem to be software related. Bluetooth switching between phone and laptop is pretty ok but at least once per day my headphones will connect to my phone and I need to shut off the phone bluetooth to get audio from my laptop. Also, there is no ""regular"" mode for the ANC, meaning that you either get the amplified sound outside of the headphones, or can feel the ANC working. There needs to be a setting that turns both off and gives the regular amount of muffling over ear headphones would normally provide. I also despise the fact that I need to use the Sennheiser app on my phone to control EQ or amount of ANC, why not make a simple desktop app that can do the same?","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2024",AFKOEAETUFFKKOLH7WK5CIUZCF4A,True,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones,

RTN9WQR625T86,5.0 out of 5 stars What you need to know...,Randall Whitted,5,"Before buying these, you gotta know some things. First, if you listen to earbuds a lot, over-ear headphones sound different. The sound is less directly in your ear, and more around you. As such, there is less impact. That doesn't mean these aren't good, they're just not shoved into your ear.Second, the source makes or breaks these. A crappy source will sound crappy on these and you'll end up blaming the headphones. It's actually a feature of the headphones though. They reproduce what you put into them very well. Go into Spotify and mess with the EQ there if you feel the need. I like sharp treble and got it that way. Change the stream setting to highest quality. Plug them into a good digital to analog converter (DAC). Try different sources and you'll see whatever you may not be liking is not the headphones. As an acoustic guitarist, I was hoping for the same sound I get with my Martin on my lap. I'd love to have headphones that sound like Tony Rice and Dave Grisman are standing on either side of me, but that's not gonna happen. Again, the source matters. These headphones are not a hand-built American acoustic guitar played by a master standing next to you, but they'll sound more like it than the majority of headphones.Third, we've become programmed to in-your-face sound. These Momentum 4 are very much ""grown-up"" headphones. They articulate. They detail. The present. But they don't floor you with over-the-top sound all through the range. There are plenty of good, inexpensive headphones and earbuds that will pop your eardrums. I personally recommend Anker for that. My Space A40 earbuds are awesome, but when I A/B tested the A40 and these Momentum 4, I realized there were instruments I didn't even realize were there when listening with the A40 earbuds.Fourth, the bluetooth is dumb at first. From what I can tell, they won't work like you'd expect until you launch the app as part of the connection process. It's fine though. Just don't give up on them right off the bat because of that.Other random thoughts - they're super UNcomfortable right away, become very comfortable rather quickly - like within minutes. Also, good headphones do have a break-in period, and these are no exception. Be sure to try the wired connection on some different sources as well. MacBooks have good DACs in them. Anker makes a good USB-C to aux adapter with a DAC in it. The bluetooth connection can sound pretty dang good though. And the microphones in this headset are almost creepy-good. Also, bluetooth range is perfectly fine. I went three rooms away in my house with no issues at all.Summary - I was thinking of returning these, but I know Sennheiser so I messed with settings and connections and I'm glad I did. They're great headphones, but the key is to remember - if your source is crap, they will faithfully reproduce that crap.","Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2023",AEJWET4WAUKOAUJKFYEZSZKWTTNA,True,104,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R2GC7X8P84LSAI,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost excellent,Lloyd,4,"After much research I decided on these. I chose them for the positive reviews and the good price pint. I really like the look as well. I purchased them in white. After receiving them I quickly downloaded the app and got stated. As many have said, the app isn’t always great. Sometimes, it doesn’t connect properly and it really annoying. I am not an audiophile or a tech person but these sound great. I use the podcast setting constantly. Music sounds pretty amazing. I also love the intuitive touch controls. I looked at the manual online and watched a ton of videos to make sure I was optimizing the features. They are pretty comfortable. The ear cups actually don’t bother me when I have earrings in or glasses on which is great. The headpiece is very soft and luxurious feeling. The automatic pause and restart is awesome when it works. Then only issue with this is that if I take them off and lay them down and do not turn them off, when you go to play something Bluetooth’d to another device, it’s will often just play on you headphones that are laying down somewhere no not on your head. The ANC is just ok. I bought these because I stupidly knocked my Bose off of my head while cleaning the pool. They still work after much drying but they don’t last long on the charge. These are nowhere near the ANC of the Bose or even AirPod Pros. I have not used the SONYs so I cannot compare those. However, I am fine with them being just ok in this feature as I use them outside to walk and run and kind of would like to be able to hear what’s going on around me without having full traffic noise. Here are my issues…..first off, every phone call that comes in, when I answer it with headphones on….it immediately disconnects the call. It works fine if I call out. I have noticed this is a problem as evidenced on messages boards but there doesn’t really seem to be much of a solution. I contacted the company to see if they. Had a solution. Their response? Just return them to Amazon, as they have a better return policy in the Sennheiser Amazon store. The return policy is 30 days. Mind you….I purchased them March 24, and my original email was sent March 29. Today is April 24. Thus, leaving me no time to return them (I DID tell them in my email when I purchased them). I asked two questions and they didn’t address the one above at all. Really unhappy with the customer service for a $300 product. So, if you’re a tech and figure out whatever issue you have; great. their wise maybe look somewhere that has better customer service. But, they DO sound great and are comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States April 24, 2023",AGHSFBOT6TPDTGZFUMTIZP577SOQ,True,24,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R3CYLDF6PLZCPT,3.0 out of 5 stars Disappointment,art,3,"Bought this headset as a replacement for my old PXC550. I had a few Sennheiser headsets over the years, and this one is major disappointment. I bought it because PXC550 was aging and I always wanted to buy momentum, because it was considered higher product line.1. Design - it is step back from original Momentum. If I wanted Sony I could buy Sony. I bought this headset because I like the brand, but design...why not copy iPods? Dumb.2. Comfort- clamping action is much stronger then PXC550 or Sony XM5(tried in store). Pads relatively hard and ears sometimes do not fit well.3. Controls - BAD, really BAD, DID I mention that they are BAD? I am comparing them to old model of PXC550.On/OFF functionality - why not to keep same function when cups are flat headset is off when turned in listening position headset is ON. With this headset you never know if the are on or off. Reviewers say ""it is not a problem because headset has large battery life"" - this is most dumb excuse you can come up with.Tap to Play/Pause - some times it works some times it does does not. You never know what will happen, will play, will it stop, will it turn off ANC?Volume Up/Down- no audible feed back when you raising or lowering the volume using headset and no immediate reaction. Why not to keep same functionality as on older headsets each volume change would respond with the sound.ANC- What ANC? most reviewers say it is slightly worse then Sony ... they are lying it is pretty much worse then anything I had, including $30 Chinese junk. This gesture adjustment does not really work, double tap sometimes work some times does not. On maximum ANC I still hear voices and passing cars. However it does cancel the wind which is good.4. Sound - Ok sound is not really bad. It is well balanced and has just a few more details then other headsets I tried Not within same price range, but within same consumer class I could hear background singer on one of the songs. It is louder then PXC550 which is good, but balance and detail is pretty much the same. This headset has no Stage at all. Sound lucking ""WOW"" feeling, it is pretty flat.I noticed this headsets has random disconnects. not really bad, but still worth to mention.I am still thinking about returning it, or keep it for few more days to see if they grow on me.I would say price (250) is pretty good for what you get.if you never had anything better it would be good headset for the money.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AGFPE3TGGCHH7S4DE5Z7HZ7ZCAUA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R3BCMJ8RYR5L76,3.0 out of 5 stars Was I just maybe expecting too much?,Giratina,3,"Based on other reviews I decided to pick these up and the btd600 dongle meant to go with it for pc etc, Honestly im pretty disappointed. First the anc may as well not exist as it blocks nothing even when set to max or adaptive, can still hear everything as if its right next to me. Second the sound quality sounds... not sure how to describe it but maybe muddy or sounding like you're listening through a barrier. The headphones also struggle to handle intense songs like edm without distorting any voices while there is any bass and almost vibrates the voice causing it to sound off (ive tested tons of eq settings). Using them wired doesn't seem to fix the quality issue either. The bass itself is fine though once adjusted depending on the song speed. The touch controls turn back on every time you turn these off even when set to off on every device you have it connected to. Comfort wise they do start to bend and hurt your ears after a while requiring constant adjusting. Overall I'm pretty disappointed for something in the $300+ range as they sound like other $100 headphones. There's a chance maybe mine is broken but the hassle of swapping them isn't worth it.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AG5Y4LSKJTORYYBYUOJ3IBGIC2LQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R1OLFI88OUFMZ9,5.0 out of 5 stars Best in class!,Shelby Yale Marr,5,"I went to BestBuy to get my hands on a few of the top contenders. Sony XM5, Bose 700, and a few others not worth mentioning. They did not have a Sennheiser momentum 4 in the store for demo, they had to be ordered. The battery life of the Sony and the Bose were better than the others they had available in store. The sound quality was good. The materials felt cheap some more than others. I did not care for the skinny headband on some of them. After trying them out, I went on Amazon’s website and ordered the Sennheiser momentum 4. The 60 hour battery life, and fast charging is amazing. The noise canceling is excellent, I work with a lot of heavy equipment, it is loud all the time. I have used them on several long flights for both music from my phone or my tablet, or the airplanes movie selection. Several of the flights had very loud and obnoxious children, the noise canceling and good volume level made it much more pleasant. The build quality of the Sennheiser momentum 4 feels much more premium than the Sony or the Bose. The sound quality and clarity is unmatched to anything that I have tried, as far as wireless headphones. The frequency response is incredible with the 42 mm drivers. The gesture controls are intuitive, and very easy to use and get used to. I can wear them for hours my head does not get tired or sore. Everyone that I have come across that has tried them wants to set for themselves. Using them at work I often have multiple phone calls, there are gestures you can use on the side control to swap between calls. The microphones built into the headset pick up your voice clearly and eliminate background noise and wind for very clear calls. They are great for short sessions, but also long sessions as I have worn them for over 12 hours in a row. I wear glasses and they do not bother me while wearing glasses. I have had them for nearly a year. The battery life is still very strong. You can go on vacation and not have to charge the headphones until you return. I had a pair of Brookstone noise, canceling headphones years ago. When they eventually failed, I picked up a pair of Sony noise, canceling headphones. The Sony’s eventually failed as well. I replaced them with Bose they were wired the wire deteriorated very rapidly. Replaced them with a set of Bose earbuds, they are handy, but for a long flight the Sennheiser’s are definitely the way to go. Amazing sound quality. Transparency mode is also a very handy feature. Double tap the side of the headphone to activate or deactivate transparency mode so you can hear what is going on around you. The ability to lift the ear cup to pause playback is very handy. They also power down when you place them in the very nice case.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2023",AGXNT7BE4PKZY7LPRQ5IMFXHPLTQ,True,19,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R2UYH59HBOTDSC,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent pair of headphones,Tyler,4,"I already had plans to buy these but after my Sennheiser CX wireless earbuds took a tumble in the washer, I kinda had to get these. I was already aware of the numerous issues that people had with these headphones but after having these for 2 weeks, I never ran into any of them.First Impression- Overall really like the look of these with the fabric headband and an all-around clean look. A little plasticky feeling but it isn't the kind of cheap plastic you would find on inexpensive headphones.Sound Quality- Now I'm not a big headphone person or audiophile guy but to me, these sound great and are probably one of the best-sounding over-ear wireless headphones I've ever owned. Super clear sound and very good bass.Call Quality- Mic is what you’d expect. Not the best but it's good enough for calls. I was able to hear clearly from people on the other end and they heard me on the other end perfectly fine. Side-Tone works great too however I don't like hearing myself so I keep it off.ANC-It really isn't that bad, although it doesn't match the quality that Sony headphones have, it's enough to water out most sounds around you however lower frequencies tend to pass through.App and Controls-The app is super easy to navigate through with a lot of settings to choose from. One of these settings would be an equalizer so you can mess around and find your own preferred sound configuration. Touch controls definitely took some time to get used to but they are very reactive to touch and I don't think you’ll need to do any double tapping. You can also disable touch controls if you don't like them. To address pairing issues, I had absolutely none. Might be different for you since I do still see these complaints every now and then.Comfort-Comfort is something that comes down to preference and to me, these were very comfortable on my head. I have a very large head so I had to adjust these to the max and they fit super well. Ear cups are nice and soft and the padding on the headband is firm on the sides and super squishy on the top. Overall super comfy on my head and I’ve yet to run into any issues with discomfort.Battery Life-Battery life is also pretty great too. 60 hours of battery life is more than plenty and can last you a whole week depending on how often you use them.Overall I think these are great all-around headphones that are great for daily use and travel. Of course, these do have some issues but they don't bother me enough to not recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2023",AEQT6ADH6CI7LIAZKS2DH2DKTMFA,True,36,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R2QVBA1G7PUXO9,5.0 out of 5 stars Love 'em,David,5,"Comfortable. Intuitive touch controls. Battery life. Design.Prior to purchase I did lots of research (thank you early adopters that do video reviews and websites that do qualitative reviews). I purchased these over other similarly priced brands based on the available features, price and design style. I have no remorse for the price I have paid.A little more depth:First, sound was a big priority for me -- I wanted a pair of headphones that reproduced sound/music as closely as an original artist may have desired. I found a website, soundguys.com, that provided a frequency-response (an audio-sweep starting from the 10's of Hz to the 10's of kHz is played through the headphones then the output noise difference is measured) graph for the headphones showing a very good sound reproduction (compared to a similarly priced set of Sony headphones these were more true to the input audio sweep).Second was design. I am a big fan of having the cups of the headphones attached to the headband via the swiveling 'pitch fork' design. Mounted/affixed to the middle of the/a headphone-cups. From an engineering/physics perspective, this means the pushing/pressing force exerted by the headband through the cups is centered from the middle of the cups, as opposed to the tops of the cup's--which invariably results in the pushing pressure being more towards the top of the cups (assumptions based on the XM5's design).Third. Comfort. The somewhat flat headband with its padding is forgettable and the pressure it supplies to the cups to the sides of one's (average size) head is sufficient -- maybe a little on the lite side. Also, the inside (head side) of the headband is a rubbery-like material, so no fears of hair/scalp oils dirtying a fabric there.Lastly, a subjective review of the sound, ANC, and call quality. I think the sound is amazing! The ANC is super cool. I've worn these on public transit (daily on the bus, and weekly on the train) and finally feel like I won't have any hearing damage from having to listen to the drone of the engine or cabin noise. You will still have some awareness of sounds around you, especially those of higher pitch/tone, but if you have music going (half volume for me) you will not hear any thing. Pass-through mode is also quite nice, though sometimes other's voices may sound quite (again, due to using half volume).Call quality is great. I held a phone call wherein I had a fan blowing on my head (wind noise). Neither I or my caller could hear any of the noise from the fan.Since owning the headphones, Sennheiser has released a firmware update for the ANC. Before and after the update I cannot empirically say I've notice any difference. Knowing Sennheiser will push updates to further improve the product is also reassuring (though for this price point, I believe most companies are doing this).Several sites/videos say that a similarly priced set of Sony's has better ANC than these, but I'll argue that you don't need a pair of Sony's to enjoy/receive a similar experience!Very subjective final thought: These (in white) look better than the competition.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2022",AFESKG7TMN4LQ6DRVCIB355WIX5Q,True,15,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
RJOEYU7BI5AO4,"3.0 out of 5 stars While these sound fantastic, unfortunately the bad overpowers the good",ThereAreOrangesEverywhere,3,"I've been a fan of Sennheiser headphones for years and I have several other wired headphones from them that I've used for years as well. After reading up on the current wireless headphone offerings from various companies I decided to buy these since I already trusted the brand and the reviews were shining.I'm an audiophile hobbyist with a large head that makes most headphones become uncomfortable after a short amount of time being worn. I also have small ears and most in-ear headphones either don't fit at all or slip out within the first 10 minutes. I have some Airpod Pros that I sometimes use, but these also slip out from my ears constantly. The Sennheiser Momentum 4's fit better than a lot of headphones I've had, however after about 30 minutes of use, they become uncomfortable for me. If they just extended out a little further I don't think that would be an issue, but they don't. I wish more headphone companies made their headphones with greater expandable options, but oh well. If you're reading this and also had the large-head problem, I have a pair of AKG K 702as that I've used for a decade and they're very comfortable.The comfort is not the main issue though. It's the software to manage the headphones, and also the software/firmware on the headphones themselves. It has trouble connecting to the headphones consistently. The headphones also would frequently (and randomly) disconnect while listening to music on my iPhone. It was incredibly frustrating, and after reading through some forums I found that it was due to more than one device being in the headphones ""Devices"" list (my wife tried these on her phone at one point). Even though the other device was not actively trying to connect and even had Bluetooth completely off, the issue was happening a lot. Once I removed the 2nd device through the app, the connectivity issues went away.That is not my main complaint with the headphones though. The ANC cannot be turned off. You can adjust it to your hearts content from full blast ANC to full transparency, but ANC is on at all times. That's not necessarily a deal breaker, but for some reason the ANC on these cans gave me instant headaches. I tried researching why this could be happening and how to reduce this, and since these headphones have some adaptive ANC capabilities I tried listening outside, in an empty room, in a car, downtown, etc. - and it always gave me a headache.If the app let you disable ANC entirely I would have gladly kept them. The sound is fantastic, especially for the price. The bass is very rich, the mids are clean and the highs are crisp without being shrill. The soundstage is extremely impressive given these are closed back. I would have thought these cost at least twice what they do on the sound alone. The battery is also super impressive, these lasted almost two weeks of daily use before I had to charge them.Sennheiser is a sound company, not a software company. If they are going to force managing features of their headphone into an app, they really need to build out the app better and have options as simple as turning on/off ANC. While I'm all for new technology and software (I work as a software engineer), I'm more old-school with devices like this specifically for this reason. If these cans had a few actual buttons or switches to toggle ANC and some other basic features instead of relying on an app and swipe gestures, I'd keep them forever.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2023",AEVMPVH3K5FBJXFMQMM6YAPNDNUA,True,15,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
RONNQB3KB0IWS,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding headphones and extraordinary battery but iOS app did not work.,PMJ,4,"I received these headphones and put them on my head and they immediately paired with my iPhone (14 Pro Max). Touch controls are a little tricky but they do work. Sound is warm, balanced and very pleasant. I have a large head and the headphones feel comfortable covering my ears correctly. They seem to be light and well balanced. Sound is well balanced without being bass heavy or 'lumpy' with excellent detail on all the types of music to which I listen (mainly jazz, classical, electronic jazz and fusion with classic pop thrown in). I have yet to compare with the direct wired connect or via USB. Probably the best noise reduction headphones I have heard and are much smoother than the Sony XM4 and XM5 and less processed than the Bose QC 45s.The iOS app did not work. I installed it after the headphones had paired with my iPhone (as instructed by the instructions), started the app which showed that they had connected but when I tapped the headphone icon, it said it had not connected and I had to power off and remove the headphones from the bluetooth list on my phone. I performed the necessary changes and tried again with no success. I tried this 5 or 6 times with the same results. I gave up and tried a number of other strategies. I reset the headphones, deleted and reinstalled the app all to no avail.The headphones sound great but the inconvenience of trying to configure them manually is less helpful so I decided to send them back.Update 1: I also have an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra) and tried the installation of the app on that phone. BT pairing was more problematic but once paired the app worked correctly. I reset the headphones using the app (deleting the BT pairing list) and updated the headphones firmware. After doing this I tried again on the iPhone and it worked correctly this time. I am not sure whether it was the complete reset to factory settings or the updated firmware but it now appears to work on both iOS and Android.","Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2023",AGTBK447OV5VAYFLVLFCMC3NOCDA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
RW0GW7VS1ML79,4.0 out of 5 stars Punching WAY above their price point but have several unfortunate annoying features,Jordan Sage,4,"I have recently trued out a number of headphones across a variety of price points (e.g., the HifiMan Arya Stealth, B&W PX7, B&O H95). These beat out all the headphones that cost more than double. They were the most engaging of the wireless 'phones to listen to and the ones I wanted to keep coming back to. The are fun and energetic sounding, and are pretty generous in sound quality across the timbres. There is nothing these do that stands out sound-wise as super great - but no great sins anywhere either, and I did not find another bluetooth headphone that had such a good, balanced whole-picture sound like these do.I did, however, almost return these.The bluetooth interrupted several important business calls with no prompting from me whatsoever (and again, I had a half dozen Bluetooth headphones by my phone and none of them automatically interrupted more than 10-15 minutes into a call - totally unprompted - like these did).The other issue is that Sennhieser tried, I suppose, to get fancy with the touch controls on the side of the Right can. The issue with this is, if you touch or rest them against anything, the buttons will go off haphazardly. No other headphone I tested had any such issue. If you even lift these to scratch your ear, they will shut off or do something unintended. The good thing though is when you are ready to listen, you put them on your head and they will synch near instantaneously and be ready to play music. That's cool. But I am learning to live with all the unwanted features and touch activation of these.Altogether, I don't believe anything will touch these at the price point, and you would be hard-pressed to find many options under $1,000 that don't require an amplifier that will either. The feature set is annoying and intrusive. The design is bland and cheap looking. But they are comfortable to wear and they sound great.

R1ZBIQTOJ15PHY,"3.0 out of 5 stars But are they, are they really?",Lost_And_Confused,3,"I am really hesitant to write a review in light of how many people have left reviews that sound like they would give their first born for these things. I am not in that camp. I have several sets of over-the-ear and in-ear headsets including the Apple Airpod Max and the new Sony MX5. Having used equipment from Senn for 30 years, I am familiar with their products and how their philosophy, so many others, has changed over that time with a leaning towards mass market. Oh, I get it...make money or close the doors. All that said, here is my real world experience. Upon opening them, I like the case, the wired adapter, etc. The headset is lightweight and very comfortable, even when wearing with glasses. That said, they are the ""cheapest looking/feeling"" headset from Senn I have ever seen...they really feel like cheap plastic crap...but that is not why you buy a headset. Just setting expectations here. The battery life claim of 60 hours is absolutely comical - I have been getting more around 12 hours (calls/music/online meetings - almost all with ANC). The ANC itself is not at the level of Apple or Sony. It works, and I have been on a couple flights with them. There does not seem to be any background noise filtering on the microphone side though - certainly not on par with Apple or Sony, though the ANC works well enough for the wearer. Max volume is lower than other brands, if that is important to you, but certainly loud enough. Bass response is significantly BETTER than Apple or Sony, though the sound quality as a whole is muddier with less staging than others. The pairing has been fairly smooth - no where as seamless as say the Airpod Max's if you are in an Apple ecosystem, but on par with most other brands. The app is a bit pointless, but given that the single button and touch controls arent the greatest, it is helpful. For example, the pinching/reverse-pinching to engage ANC sort of works...? I did have my first pair of these die after about 10 hours of use - would no longer pair and the lights just did a non stop light show - but got them replaced through Amazon without issue, as I had them only 2 days. Conclusions? Given that the Apple product is always on sale for $100 off, the price point between all three products (The Sony MX5's, the Airpod Max's and these) are within $100 of each other, I would have a hard time recommending these to friends or family. I really cannot find a single compelling reason to select these over competing products. I mean, they are bad by any means, just bland. They don't stand out from a looks, sound, ANC, build quality, functionality, or any other way...they work, well enough, and in the class they are in they are fairly priced. I honestly feel you could do better with the Apple Airpod Max if you are a big Apple user or the Sony MX5's otherwise - and be happier with either of those versus these. In fact, if plastic, lower quality builds, but with good sound, good bass response and decent ANC is your thing, you could do better with the over the ear model from Status Audio and save a couple hundred bucks. Of course, all of the above is my personal opinion, not paid, no free samples, no fancy audio test equipment...YMMV.","Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2022",AFYGCCFUGZL6PNRESNIUYWDTPMJQ,True,30,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

R3T563LHCTJ4N1,4.0 out of 5 stars Love the headphones except for the garbled noise at times!!!!,azsteve01,4,"Sennheiser headphones have been my main headphones for watching TV since 2016 when i purchased the RS-175 wireless headphones. Roku has created a Private Listening mode and you cannot switch from headphone to tv/soundbar speakers easily since Roku disabled the TOSLink/headphone jack when you are using the Dolby sound hardware. A solution was needed and since you can connect to the soundbar via bluetooth the decision was made to find a bluetooth headphone that met my standards. Because of my loyalty to Sennheiser headphones the Momentum 4 were chosen.As stated Roku has created a Private Listening feature that makes it hard to use wire/fibre connection and bluetooth is the best solution to resolve the issues making it easier to switch between speakers and headphones.Major Issue:The only main issue with the Momentum 4 headphones is when you first connect, the sound is garbled for 5 to 10 seconds. You can either wait for the sound to clear up (annoying) or restart the video which can be a pain. Youtube and Plex are my main video apps i use and with youtube having to restart the videos each time gets old fast. The garbled sound is the same no matter what firmware is used.Minor issues:When you have the Momentum 4 connected to the app (iPhone) every time you are disconnected from the TV/Soundbar you have to use the app to reconnect. This is not convenient if the phone is not near. Unfortunately Roku has decided to disconnect any bluetooth connected after 5 minutes of idle time to save battery power on the headphones. This is not a Momentum 4 issue but reconnecting with the app make this cumbersome. Because of this problem the app is not being used at all and the headphones are set to factory default.The fit is not as good as the RS-175, ear cups need to be bigger.Pros:Excellent Sound, Long Battery Life, Noise Cancelling (even cancels out conversations), Touch Features, Light WeightI would recommend these to others but only if Sennheiser fixes the garbled issue.","Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2023",AHVWXOJUZYGFL7XQW5OY73KHERGQ,True,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

R30434Q2LI61Q,"5.0 out of 5 stars great sound, cancellation and battery but . . .",mike,5,"I decided on these because of the reviews. And price was right for me.Here is my honest opinion. Sound is awesome, and noise cancelling is good. The special features (like headphone turn off and on as you take them off and on. Side ear swipe controls and sennheiser app for more controls) Well . . . if they work . . . it is very nice. You can only run the app through your phone. So that is a drawback. I found the swipe controls don't hardly work unless you are using the app itself. So if I have music say on amazon music unlimited through my laptop none of the feature work well, or at all. If I am running my music through my phone and with the app the features work at first but the the longer I listen the less likely they are bound to work. Meaning the swipe controls for vol, skip song and tap on and off and turning on noise cancellations setting. I lose connection more then I should for no reason.Lets just say I have to go back to my phone app to turn on and off the feature to get them to work correctly way too much. So If you are OK with great sound and noise cancellation with a super long battery life and can put up with the flaws of the special features that you paid for, then buy these. They are very comfortable for me. Sound was too good to send them back though, just disappointed in the special features that sometimes work and sometimes not. (haven't used phone feature at all yet)update 06-16-24: So I now have had these about a year now. My opinion has changed and I thought I would update my review. I am old (62) so I still do a lot of listening through my MP3 players (I have several - not always listening through my phone). My biggest gripe when I got them was the controls and getting the touch features to work properly. Well, it may have been operator error and just getting used to the headphones. I don't seem to be having any trouble with any listening device anymore. When I take my headphones off my head they stop and when I put them back on they start. One thing that I had trouble with early on. I have had a chance to try out the phone features and sound since the purchase and it is pretty darn good. I can not compare to other competitors though, And I don't use that a lot.So sound is great, comfort is great, battery is great and features are now upgraded to great as wellI love em.

Tested on multiple devices, all of which are up to date.To future-proof my review (because I won't remember to edit my review once the firmware problems have been addressed), I rated these 4 stars based on the assumption that there will be a future fix to the firmware problems. If taking the firmware into account, I think I'd rate these 2 stars (as of 8/31/2022).Pros:These headphones have quality sound, probably on par with the price point. Not significantly better than my PXC 550-II's, but they do have a bit more depth and bass.Their noise cancellation is good, but not as good as my Bose QC35’s, which is to be expected.The battery life is incredible. I don't think I'm getting 60 hours (volume kept at around 20-40%), but they're still awesome.Cons:These are nowhere near as comfortable as my Sennheiser PXC 550-II headphones. They put more pressure on my ears/temples, and the headband is way firmer. My head is aching after about 30 minutes of use.There are significant firmware issues (my firmware is up to date, as of 8/31/22):When using the auto power off mode, they turn on (and sync to your phone) any time they’re moved. This will of course silence your phone’s alerts, as they’re playing over the headphones that you didn’t mean to turn on.When using the on-head detection, they keep turning on and off while they're sitting around my neck.Whenever I answer my phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max) and change the output to these headphones it just hangs up the phone. Haven't tried answering using the headphone's touch controls, it's possible that would work.While the transparency mode is a nice feature, it's almost laughable compared to my AirPod Pro's and Sony WF-1000XM4's. It sounds just barely better than wearing non-noise cancelling headphones.These can connect to 2 devices at a time, but when switching between paired (and connected) devices (for example: listening to audio on my tablet, when I get a text alert on my phone, which interrupts tablet audio for a second, before switching back to tablet again), and whenever I answer my phone, as mentioned above, audio quits playing over my headphones. My phone says it's still connected, but it doesn't show up as an output in any apps. I have to reconnect it to my phone to get it working again.Whenever I pair them with a new device, it disconnects from existing connected devices. I have to reconnect afterward.As much as I want to like these headphones, until Sennheiser fixes these software issues, it's just not worth the hassle.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2022",AENHFSUN5AOQRWBL5HVKOFBRSN4A,True,56,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R9UOJPHMC1N5R,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones with a few nitpicks,Stan Jarensky,5,"I'm coming from the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones that I've been using for basically everything over the past few years. I bought these new headphones primarily because of AptX-Adaptive, their glowing battery life, and the fact that my M3W were starting to wear down a bit.Let me reiterate; I use these for EVERYTHING. Everything from my phone, iPad, multiple PCs, planes, etc. etc. If you want to use these on PC, I strongly suggest in either an AptX or preferably an AptX-Adaptive transmitter (see the Creative BT-W4) to avoid unnecessary latency. It's an absolute must if you're gaming though you will lose the ability to make calls.Regardless, these sound fantastic. I had no complaints about the M3W and while these aren't a significant upgrade, they do sound clearer and more crisp. The build quality is tricky. On one hand, they lack the metal frame that the M3W had that made them unique and confidence-inspiring. These are almost entirely plastic and their uniqueness has been subdued that it can easily be mistaken for countless other pairs. That being said, they feel solid and the plastic does not feel ready to snap at any point. The earcups in particular are an upgrade in both fitment and leather quality. They lose the ability to fold like the M3W but instead you get a slim HARDSHELL carrying case. I get why some people are against them no longer folding but as someone who constantly takes them out of my backpack, I LOVE the slimmer case.The capacitive touch functions I'm not sure how I feel about yet. The only physical button doubles as a manual on/off and a pairing button. The rest is controlled by the cover of the right ear cuff. Most of the functions are fine and intuitive, but to switch between ANC, off, and transparent hearing, you need to do a weird pinch like you would to zoom on a touch screen. It's particularly weird because there's multiple levels so you need to do it multiple times. I'm sure I'll get used to it but I would've preferred a physical button or switch like the M3W.ANC is good. It's NOT as good as Sony's but it's not far off. I can't say much about the battery life as I've only had them for a day but all reviews are backing up Sennheiser's claims of 60h which is literally class-leading. The Android app for fine tuning settings and EQ is fine. Nothing to write home about. Multipoint connection (pairing to two devices at once) is back though it's not a feature I intend to use very often.All in all, I'm very happy. They're expensive but the price is competitive with their rivals. The main draw for me towards Sennheiser has been AptX support. It's something that most of the competition is missing and as a large amount of my usage is gaming, it's absolutely necessary. But the sound quality is great. The features are great. I'd highly recommend these if you're in the market.","Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2022",AFWSMMKN2GVUKOJA4BDMDRSG7JZQ,True,15,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

RJB49JIZ1OE9H,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but not great due to finicky features.",Ryan M Robinson,4,"The sound, noise cancellation, durability, and battery life were the reasons I bought these headphones, and they've delivered in those areas. Sadly, I'm knocking a star off the overall rating because of their ""quality"" of life features and short range.The headphones are meant to sense when they're on your head or not. Sadly, these think they're on my head when they're not, and not on my head when they are, with annoying frequency.Occasionally the ""buttons"" stop working. I use quotes because the actual button works fine, but the tap controls seem to stop working randomly. They'll do the little noise in my ear that indicates the headphones have registered me tapping, but have no actual effect.Further, I live in a house of about 950 sq. ft., yet if I leave the 8x8 room that is my office there's a good chance the sound will start cutting in and out due to the poor range of these headphones. I had a pair of $60 headphones before these, and the range was twice as good on those. This results in sound skipping in and out if I'm more than 6 feet away from my computer, or about 8 feet with no walls in between. It would be nice to be able to fold laundry in the next room over while listening to these, but I cannot.Overall, great sound quality, durability, noise cancelling (very important as I'm work from home with a toddler and an infant in the house), and battery life (I use them 8-10hrs per day and charge once per week), but poor quality of life. For the price, I expected headphones that work correctly.","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AESDI6RME6JBOBVQLOLCSJKOA7GQ,True,20,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

R3QDH5SFCC0EE9,5.0 out of 5 stars Momentum 4 vs Sony WH-1000XM5,Matthew,5,"I've been a Sennheiser fan for a while now and wanted to give these a shot vs the fan favored Sony WH-1000XM5s. Used the Momentum 4s for around a week and was incredibly impressed with the battery life, ease of use, and the sound quality. If you have some audiophile grade equipment with a separate DAC/Amp combo this does not sound as good. That being said, this is miles above alternatives in it's price range.After adjusting to the sound of the Sennheisers for a few days, I immediately had a negative reaction when trying out the Sonys. To my ears they had a noticably dryer sound profile where the highs and mids sounded muffled and flat in comparison (Note: not accuracy flat, just plain dull sounding). The bass is pretty equivalent, at least in EDM/metal/hip hop genres. I listened for a few hours in the Sonys and just couldn't find any songs I thought sounded measurably better than the Sennheisers. Even listening to the same song on the tablet and phone with both headphones back to back, everything was brighter, clearer, and warmer in the Sennheisers and have a noticably better build quality. My first initial reaction to Sennheiser build quality was negative because they felt much lighter than I was expecting having used more serious headphones. The Sonys felt even lighter and more plastic-y/cheaper in comparison.The noise cancelling was noticably better in the Sonys than the Sennheisers, which may or may not be a deal breaker for some. I would imagine the Sonys would perform better on an airplane, but for home/office use I was perfectly happy with both.TLDR: The Sennheisers are the no brainer choice for me.**Momentum 4 quirks/nit picking:- My head gets hot in any headphones with leather ear cups, I could not find alternative/cooler padding which is worth the sound/seal trade off.- The sensors to know if it's on your head are pretty sensitive. It's good when you lift off an ear to hear someone else in the room, they pause. It's bad when you take them off, they 'sleep' on the desk, anything brushes/touches the headphones. It will automatically switch your audio source from your phone back to the headphones. Depending on how often you listen to audio on your phones speaker or are around where these will be when you are not using them, it's easier to turn them off when not in use to avoid having to change your media output on your phone back to the speaker. Samsung phones have a quick media output switch in the drop down quick menu, but not all phones make it this easy.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AGJ3EARFU6PJA75WKR76Z7WUOLNA,True,27,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R3S9UDPCJTRMN0,"5.0 out of 5 stars M4’s vs XM5’s, if you’re after sound quality this is it.",Seth Montgomery,5,"Sound Quality:So first of all, I have been a big fan of Sony’s wireless lineup and decided to take a departure with these. After these arrived, I did a direct comparison on these vs Sony’s XM5’s, with EQ to my liking and without (across several genres.) The M4’s even without any EQ adjustments beat my XM5’s with them. Man, these things sound great. Clear, precise, open sound. The treble is truly so much more detailed than on the XM5’s, and the midrange and bass feel balanced in more naturally. When I switched back to XM5’s to compare, I was actually shocked at just how much I felt like I was missing in comparison.Comfort:The XM5’s spoil you a bit with their insane plush earcups and super light weight, but I was expecting a bigger difference between those and the M4’s. For me, these are perfectly comfortable. XM5’s definitely win here, but the SQ on the M4’s more than makes up for that.Noise Cancelling:I’m not the person to give the best feedback on this, it’s the last thing I care about. However, If noise cancelling happens to be your main consideration, it’s XM5 here.Setup/connectivity:I was prepared for problems and inconveniences based on reviews and got none. Smooth experience for me so far.In summary, GREAT sound, and if that’s your biggest consideration, I don’t know if you’ll find better elsewhere in Bluetooth headphones anywhere close to this price point. All of the other issues I’ve read about on here before buying were non-issues for me.

RQ0W5FUGCFR5X,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, bad UX Design.",Cacho K,2,"The PXC-550 headphones were my go-to for the past three years, striking the perfect balance between quality sound and comfort, with just a couple of drawbacks: a lack of USB-C support and less-than-ideal battery life. Eager for an upgrade, I transitioned to their successor MOMENTUM, hoping for improvements. On paper, the new model seemed to promise just that—a better, more refined listening experience. However, while the upgrade delivered in some areas, it faltered in others, revealing design flaws that the PXC-550 had already mastered.On the plus side, the sound quality is exceptional, with noise cancellation that effectively silences the outside world, and a battery life that feels almost endless. These improvements alone make the headphones a significant leap forward.But not all changes are for the better. The new design is bulkier. More frustratingly, the intuitive fold-to-turn-off (and on) feature of the PXC-550 has been omitted. The satisfying click of the folding switch, which once brought a sudden moment of reassurance—a Deus ex Machina moment between you and this piece of machinery—is gone. Now, turning off the headphones requires holding down a button for an awkwardly long pause, a process that can accidentally trigger pairing mode instead of powering down. This seemingly small change significantly impacts the user experience, transforming seamless transitions into moments of annoyance.Imagine this: You're about to start your car journey, only to discover your headphones have remained on, constantly attempting to connect to your phone, disrupting the peace of your drive. Or picture yourself at your desk, a sudden visitor arrives, and you're caught in an awkward dance of trying to turn off your headphones, a delay that interrupts the flow of life.This shift from the elegantly simple act of folding your headphones to turn them off and on to a cumbersome, button-dependent process adds up, not just in seconds wasted but in the sheer inconvenience it represents, especially when you know how effortless it once was. The PXC-550 made life smoother, akin to having a trusted steed by your side in the relentless battle of daily existence—a companion so reliable, its absence is profoundly felt.In light of these experiences, one can't help but yearn for a simple solution: a PXC-550 reimagined with USB-C. Such a proposition seems a minor ask for the return of what was lost—the instant gratification and reassurance of effortlessly powering down by folding, a feature that made the PXC-550 an indispensable part of life's arsenal.One could say that the new headphones, while technologically superior, miss the mark on understanding the rhythm of life. The joy of technology is not just in its capability but in its ability to blend seamlessly into our lives, enhancing without complicating. The previous model understood this, becoming more than just a tool for listening—it was a companion in the epic battle of everyday life.As it stands, despite its technological strides, the newer model leaves something to be desired for those of us who cherish both the journey and the simplicity of interaction with our gadgets. In essence, the quest for improvement should not forsake the intuitive pleasures of the past.Btw 80 seconds a day with this button nonsense, equals to 8 hours a years of frustration.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AF3JMHEBBABMCAMCXQHQBEXC2ONQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R1HEPV34OXKJS3,5.0 out of 5 stars Vastly superior to Sony in a couple of ways...,Amazon Customer,5,"While I used them regularly, I took very good care of my Sony wh-xb910n headphones, and yet they still fell apart within a year. I know it's slightly unfair to compare the Momentum 4 to this particularly Sony headphone but I didn't expect the Sony's to compare in terms of sound quality (they don't come close) or noise cancelling (the Sony's were pretty similar honestly... very good on both). But I did expect quality design and construction since it's virtually identical to higher priced Sony's. Bottom line: Sennheiser has quality construction and Sony doesn't. As soon as you pick up a pair of the Sony's, it's easy to tell that they are somewhat fragile. I even had a pretty good notion of where they would break... and I was right. The Sennheiser's are much more robust, and really feel like they can handle some tough use.I also found the app to be very intuitive and easy to use, unlike a few other reviewers... definitely easier than the Sony app.My only slight complaint is the touch sensitive control feature.

R2LOLFHZ6R8BHD,5.0 out of 5 stars Sound great and usage is very streamlined,Henry,5,"I like how most Sennheiser headphones sound, and these are no exception. The app also lets you further tune the sound to your liking if you feel the need to, and if you don't want to play around with the EQ options, you can just use the ""sound personalization"" feature which is basically a quiz that will help create an optimal sound setting for you. The usage experience with these is the most streamlined I have had with any headphones so far. I use my headphones primarily with my PC, and with older headphones switching the connection from my PC to my phone was a pain, and because of that I rarely did it. With these, you have multi-point connection, which allows you to connect to 2 devices at once, and the headphones will switch between them based on which one is playing audio. That, combined with the auto on and off feature, means I can just pick these up off my desk and put them on, then use my PC and/or phone as needed without thinking about it, and then just plop them back on my desk when I'm done and they will shut down automatically. There are however a couple of things I can think of to complain about. Number one is I wish Sennheiser made a dedicated Windows app to change settings directly from a PC, but the multi-point connection means this isn't really a big deal anymore because they are always connected to my phone anyway if I want to change settings. Number 2, I would like to have some kind of audio queue when I reach the midpoint between transparency mode and ANC. As is, when you are using the touch controls to scroll between full ANC and full transparency mode, you get an audio queue when you reach either of those settings, but the midpoint where you have neither ANC nor transparency mode active isn't obvious unless you pull out the app and check where it is set. A small issue but it would further improve ease of use with these. Overall, I'm super happy with them.

They absolutely have better noise canceling, but when listening to music or a movie it is much less noticeable.

R2L5D070KJ5IMJ,3.0 out of 5 stars The firmware is not up to par,Lumiere,3,"Pros- Comfortable to wear- Long battery life- Neutral sound- Transparency mode- Works wiredCons- Software is horrible- Firmware is horrible- Transparency mode amplifies wind noises more than voiceMost of my headphones are open back, so I wanted a pair of closed headphones for the office. Since I usually use Sennheiser headphones, that and the transparency mode swayed me to get this over Bose QC45 and Sony 1000XM4.I'm not sure I made the right choice. Almost none of the features work properly.Mine keeps turning off or disconnecting. Listen to 1-3 songs and it'll cut off in the middle of a song. Several times an hour sometimes. Tried it where I don't really have much interference, and same exact thing. Tried wearing it one night to listen to music while sleeping, and it just turned off randomly after about 20 minutes of playing. So it paused my music.Take them off and sometimes they'll still keep playing music. Sometimes, I bump into it laying flat on my desk and it'll start playing music. Tap the right side it clear a click, and music will keep playing. Swipe 2-3 times to change songs and it might do it on the first try or never. Neither my car nor my bluetooth speakers have this type of issues. Then sometimes, you adjust them because they feel like they're falling a bit, and you'll trigger the pause.The battery life is pretty good, thankfully. Because it'll stay on sometimes for hours and not turn off. This is with the 15 minutes auto shut down. So you might come back the next morning and it dropped from 90% to 70% because it never turned off.The transparency mode is... just ok. It makes the AC in my office much louder than when I have my headphones off. Like twice as loud. Unless I turn on max wind ANC. But then sound always sound muffled. But even at max transparency and low music volume, I cannot comprehend anyone talking. It sounds like it amplifies constant noise much more than occasional noise.If I wear them while washing dishes, the ANC works really well here too. So it seems to work best with constant noise.The Android App is also extremely slow. You open it, and it has to connect. After it connects, it's unresponsive for another 5 seconds or so. So it takes 10-15 seconds to open settings.I was expecting a quick button to toggle between listening to music, and transparency mode. Right now, it takes a good 15-20 seconds to adjust. Imagine telling someone to wait 20 seconds while you enable the feature, instead of spending 0.5 second removing them.Additional notes: I didn't buy them for the ANC. I care more about low leakage so I'm not disturbing other people in the office. It's also why I wanted transparency mode, so I can still hear other people if they want something.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2022",AGJDE3TR26ZJIIR5CINP4GMUWLCA,True,11,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

The default eq curve sounds very pleasant with clean translation on all types of music. The low end is present without an unnatural boost, the mids are clean and defined, and the highs are crisp and silky without causing listening fatigue. The Soundstage is also wide with excellent separation.The app is intuitive with options for all aspects of the product. The only weird thing I've noticed is that boosting frequencies (such as highs or lows for example) using the eq has somewhat of a compression affect on the audio when pushed too heavily. Instead, cutting or lowering unwanted frequencies dials everything in like a champ.Overall I'm extremely satisfied. 👍","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2024",AFOM6TBSTO35DPNHEISJXHADKD3Q,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R2EMRYUEWAB9JV,4.0 out of 5 stars Too Much Low Bass; Not Ideal for Aircraft Travel,JCW2,4,"Really good sound, clean and clear with great frequency response. The one sad detail is WAY too much low bass. This is not to say it's bad bass, and it reaches much lower frequencies than most phones. It's tight and musical, but it's enough at the bottom end to cause audible distortion in higher frequencies during dense orchestral passages. (This is one reason speaker manufacturers use separate drivers for bass and treble.) I agree with the excellent review by M&N (under ""Other Countries"") except that only a 1 dB reduction in bass is not enough. These phones start to sound reasonably realistic on music with a lot of low bass after a 6 dB bass reduction (the max provided by the equalizer in the app), but I would prefer even more, preferably affecting only the very low end.Another problem potential buyers should consider is that there seems to be ZERO support from the manufacturer for this product. (Part of the problem could be that Sennheiser's consumer products division has been sold to a new company calling itself ""Sennheiser Hearing,"" so they might get this worked out in time.) So it's currently impossible to get operation and usage questions answered. Right now it appears that the equalizer settings are not applied when listening to a wired audio source. Since this is a major application of noise-cancelling phones -- think airplane travel, where Bluetooth is not allowed -- it constitutes a major drawback.Another issue for travel is the heavy, bulky case that comes with these phones. The phones themselves are reasonably compact, weighing about 10.3 oz, but the case is thicker and way stiffer than necessary to protect them and weighs a hefty 13.7 oz, more than doubling the total.Update 03/09/23: Access to technical support is improving lately, at least by telephone. When I finally got hold of them, I was told that, indeed, it is normal function that the phones do NOT apply any user equalization settings when used with an analog (phone-cable) input.","Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2023",AEPJX4BN6PLNQ7ZQPJYNDJBSBXCA,True,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R10V36NAFXZEZA,4.0 out of 5 stars Wanted to Rate This Five Stars,Polarbear,4,"I loved these headphones (Momentum 4). It quickly became my favorite, even better than the Sony MX5. The sound was awesome with a full spectrum down to the deepest base without muddy low frequencies as with nearly all other headphones including the MX5. I used these every day for just over a month to put me just out of Amazon return window. Suddenly the right speaker started crackling and popping. I was in such disbelief that this was happening. It was so sad for me that I couldn't listen to them anymore. I was very disappointed, and I really wanted them to work! So I ordered the another pair from Best Buy, and I ordered another from Amazon. Yeah, I really wanted these to work! The same day the Best Buy pair arrived and I started listening to them, it took about 4 hours before this one like the other one started crackling and popping, except it was not as bad, and it was in the left speaker. I was so much more disappointed! Fortunately I was able to return this one to Best Buy right away. I also cancelled the second order from Amazon. I really want to know what's up! I tried everything to make the crackling and popping go away. I restarted my phone, updated the headphone firmware, nothing worked. Now I have a broken pair and I guess I should use the 2-year warranty to have Sennheiser fix it or replace it. Can't return them to Amazon. If I could trust that the next one I receive will last, I would go ahead and get another one right now. Just so you know, I collect Bluetooth headphones, and I have over 30 pairs including the best of Sony, Bose, and other premium brands. I've never had an issue with any of these other pairs. This sucks! My rating of one star is solely due to this issue with two separate pairs. If the pair worked, I would rate them a solid five stars! They are AWESOME! There hope this issue can be fixed. I want my Sennheiser Momentum 4 back! One star should elevate this concern so that others are cautious when they buy one, and know that it may fail within so many hours of use.

They are not perfect at noise canceling, but they do remove background to the point I can enjoy music or movie while ""escaping from the plane"", yet not be oblivious to the flight attendant offering me dinner. They sound good - not the loudest but that's probably good for long listening. And I can use bluetooth with my Droid, or plug-in to the plane. But a key criterion was battery life. I literally flew around the world on a single charge. The tiniest quibble is the touch controls, which might do something I don't understand and have trouble undoing now and then.

R2BABA4LYTEDVO,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones, iffy connectivity",anonamazon,5,"These headphones are among the best I've ever heard; their sound quality is unmatched in the area. Sennheiser is well known for this, and definitely live up to expectations here. You can tune them to your liking with an optional bass boost toggle in the app that makes music very punchy, which in my opinion adds a lot to these headphones.While the experience on mobile has been seamless with no issues, the same cannot be said for desktop. Periodically on desktop there is connection dropout with bursts of static upon reconnection.Notwithstanding the connection, this pair of headphones are my first with ANC. I think it works well enough, although from what I've seen it's hardly comparable to Sony's XM5s.The touch controls are sensitive, as many others have said. However, I don't find it to be much of an issue on a day-to-day basis. While having buttons would be nice, I find the touch controls to be rather intuitive and have come to like them.Overall, with the great sound and controls, I can easily say it's worth the price and more than makes up for the slight issues that you may come across when using them.

These might be the most perfect headphones I ever used and I am absolutely an authority when it comes to headphones, as I use them 5 hours a day and have bought every model on the market for 20+ years.The sound is so very clear and I hear frequencies I never heard before in all my old music. Blows away the HD600s. Incredible. Flawless. No other manufacturer can match this, definitely not Sony or even Bose. The closest are the Apple studio headphones but still not really by a very significant margin. Apple did make some very clever in ear wired headphones in 2010 that are fairly close but no longer manufacture those. Forget airpod prosThe ANC is the best I ever heard as well, too good actually I almost got hit by a car. It’s kind of unbelievableNo issues with the bluetooth and it connects to two devices at once without any issues, switching automatically as the sources produce sound. Flawless operation and the app is simple and well thought outThe build quality is perfect. Design is very stylish and classy. Touch sensor almost never goes off by accident. Premium materials, super light, very comfortable I even fell asleep wearing themThe battery (!!!!) lasts 60 hours at full volume and these things can be loud. 60 hours! and they charge in about 1 and a half.So, perfection. PERFECTION. These are the best I ever had. In fact these might be the best headphones in the history of the EarthUpdate: Ok they aren’t perfect. What appears to be a firmware bug disables the touch controls randomly and you need to restart the headphones to get them back. Well, whatever. Still 9.999/10Update 2: So the firmware has two major issues.1) You are forced to disable the head sensor because if you take off and then put back the headphones too quickly it disables the touch controls bc of a bug. Unfortunately this means they won’t auto off and your 60 hour battery runs down continuously even without use and might as well be a 10 hours. Facepalm.2) The ANC setting resets every time you recharge and can only be reset from the app. This is deliberate IMO so they force you to keep opening the app bc it’s spyware","Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2023",AGNTDROPGCQOTPJUEENZL7KDDR2Q,True,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
RKREDCIKWK311,4.0 out of 5 stars Finally...one of the best out there!,James Irmiger,4,"I've been holding off on this review until I lived with these for a while. I got them when they launched and put them head to head against the Bowers & Wilkins, Sony XM4's and 5's, Master & Dynamic, and Dali...all ANC, Bluetooth, etc, etc.. I'll summarize as best I can.In -kinda- the same price range, they all sound good. The Sony's are muddy, the Bowers a little over equalized, the M&D are clear as a bell, but lack bass, and the Dali's are smooth as butter, but have poor construction (broke 2). Finally, the Momentum 4's are a touch bass heavy, but with a little equalization, that goes away and they turn nicely neutral.My biggest gripe was usability, not sound. The 4's have switched to a massive touch surface on the right cup. Normally, I don't mind newer tech, but OMG! Anything getting near them makes a selection. Hair, collars, pillows, you name it. After 7 months, they finally fixed it with firmware 2.13.18. You can now disable the touch controls, but you still can't adjust the sensitivity, or the stock control gestures. Ah well, can't be perfect, but they did also add a new automatic sound tuning feature that really works.I like the sound profile a lot, they're built well for plastic, they have a nice case, ANC is 80% of the big boys, but lacks their cabin pressure, mics are awesome for calls, and a big as heck battery to boot.

R12D0ZLRZ4AQC7,5.0 out of 5 stars So Glad I Ignored the Bad Reviews!!!,HSPS2,5,"I was concerned about the number of medium/bad reviews but went ahead and ordered based on the many excellent reviews and Sennheiser's stellar reputation. After lots of reading, I came to believe that many of the bad reviews resulted from user error and perhaps compatibility/connectivity issues related to the often quirky Apple (iPhone/iPad/iHome) interface. After about one month of using the M4 headphones, I couldn't be happier. Yes, there is a learning curve with the touch controls and Sennheiser's app, especially for us seniors, but with practice, I'm now very comfortable and proficient. FYI, I use the M4's almost exclusively with my late model MOTO phone via bluetooth (android 12). Also, I have other high-end headphones for comparison. Here's what I really like about the M4's:The headphones updated flawlessly (about 25 minutes) right out of the box.The app installed and runs without a hitch - almost zero lag with all adjustments.The M4's connect immediately with my phone and the app, and stay connected.I've never experienced the mysterious ""turning on while in the case"" or when not wearing the headphones.Great Sennheiser sound for my music (Amazon Music). The rich, full sound with pleasant base is enhanced even further when I turn on Dolby Atmos Smart Audio in my phone's settings. (I thought the Sennheiser app might override this feature but it doesn't. I love the sound.)Call sound is very clear. Most people I speak with say they wouldn't know I'm using the headphones.Noise cancelling/transparency has a wide range of adjustment and I can easily shut out the noisy world - it's right up there with the biggest names in noise cancelling.Battery life is unbelievable. OMG, it never seems to go down!The oval, fairly large ear cups cover my large ears without problem.The understated look of the M4's is appreciated. I don't need to be a walking bill-board or get any attention in public.The carrying case is one of the best I've seen - compact, nice padding, stiff. Great protection!The headphones are comfortable to wear for a few hours. There is a little more clamping force than some others, but they stay put.Overall, a great purchase.

R3RQ6GTUWPK41X,5.0 out of 5 stars Momentum 4 Unboxing and review,Mrs. Wendy L. Stefan,5,"The media could not be loaded. From the moment I pulled these from the box I knew I was in for a treat. They have a solid build quality and are lightweight without feeling cheap. The earmuffs are soft and comfortable even wearing glasses.Where these truly shine is sound quality. Right out of the box they sound warm and detailed. With minor adjustments to the EQ through the Sennheiser app they are truly delightful! I played some test tracks and warmed them up with some brown noise for an hour or so, however whether that is necessary or not is debatable.I have not tried calls with them yet but the noise cancelling is quite good. The settings in the app allow you to customize the ANC and unless it is set to automatically adjust, you can change the amount of ANC using touch on the right speaker.Touch controls were easy to use and function as expected. The headphones pause playback if you take the right cup off your ear which could be frustrating for some, but If you want to hear someone, slide the left side off your ear and the media will not pause.Definitely a high quality set of headphones built to last from a brand known for quality. So far I have not experienced any of the app issues others have mentioned. Firmware update went smoothly and took significantly less than the 22min it had initially told me it would take.I would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone looking for a quality, well balanced and detailed sounding set of headphones. Does not get super loud would be my only complaint if I had one.

R36ZIV2E3IZWRL,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite noise cancelling headphone,WT,5,"I recently added the Momentum 4 to my collection of noise cancelling headphones. The others I currently own are the Sennheiser PXC550, Technics EAH-F70N, Sony WH-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM5. I don't have any Bose headphones because I don't care for their sound signature. For noise cancellation, the Sony XM5 are the best, but only by a small margin over the XM4. However, the XM5's adaptive noise cancellation cannot be turned off and for some, this is a big negative. There are people who want maximum noise cancellation all the time. Not just when they are in very noisy conditions. The Momentum 4 also uses adaptive noise cancellation but unlike the XM5, it can be turned off.For maximum noise cancellation, I prefer the XM5. Especially for long flights. I also carry the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds for when I get tired of wearing headphones. In almost all other situations, I prefer the Momentum 4 and Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds for their ""nearly as good"" noise cancellation and superior comfort and sound. I prefer the Sennheiser sound because I find the Sony to be too bright for long listening sessions. They can be fatiguing for me. The Sennheiser sounds more natural, and the sub-bass is really good for a headphone. I also find the Momentum 4 to be more comfortable than the XM5 especially if I wear them for more than an hour or so.Random thoughts:The XM5 is louder than the Momentum 4.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are not as compact as the XM4 and PXC550 respectively.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are the same shape, but the Momentum 4 case is slightly smaller.The Momentum 4 has thicker earpads and are more comfortable than the XM5.The Momentum 4 sub-bass will rattle your brain more than the XM5.The Momentum 4 has an automatic switch-on/off feature that can be somewhat annoying at times. It can also be switched on and off manually.The Momentum 4 battery life is super long.","Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2022",AHZKXYBFWRA53YQ6TPGOZN3DQQEA,True,5,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

But for $350+ headphones, I expected more from the audio quality.Am I accustomed to a standalone amp and wired closed-back headphones? Yes. Do I use wireless headphones otherwise? All the time (mostly buds). Do these senheisers blow me away? No.The details in the audio is very solid, but where it lacks is sheer power. Do I intend to blast my ears at full volume? Absolutely not, but with ALL my other wireless headphones, I'm usually floating around half volume, while with these, I'm always a click or two away from full volume, which is crazy... I'm only 35 and have near perfect hearing, so something with these just feels off, like something an update could rectify to unlock a bit more volume capacity. I've heard others trying 3rd party apps to increase volume, which does work, but I find that an annoying workaround.The noise canceling is almost non existent, which I read prior to buying but I was still surprised at their lack of noise canceling ability. Ambient noise is audible, and this is why the volume is an issue, it's a vicious cycle.The touch controls work well but can be a little finicky, especially the autopause feature which stops music upon removing the headphones from your head.Overall, good headphones, but not amazing for the price and those who like to hear their music in louder environments.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2023",AEPQE6ZBDHU2PHPUNTN5CDBSPFNA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

Eager to experience a distinct sound quality, I spent several hours with the Momentum 4 and indeed found their sound to be uniquely different. Compared to my WH820NB, the detail was significantly richer; I could truly feel the presence of each instrument, offering an immersive experience. However, there was an aspect I found unacceptable—the vocals. The vocal reproduction was surprisingly lackluster, sounding flat and almost unnerving. The rich instrumentals and detail seemed to completely overshadow the vocals, resulting in a muffled vocal experience while listening to music. Of course, audio perception is subjective, but I genuinely felt that aside from the detail and presence, the WH820NB performed better in vocal reproduction.On the plus side, the Momentum 4 excels in comfort and battery life. I'm quite fond of the headphones' design—simple yet premium, with a tactile quality that feels far from plasticky. The battery's longevity and the rich EQ options available in the mobile app are commendable features. However, the Bluetooth performance is profoundly disappointing. Whenever the headphones are connected to both a phone and a computer, playback stutters unless one of the connections is turned off. At times, the Bluetooth connection drops out entirely, causing the app to crash upon each attempt to reconnect, necessitating a reset of the Bluetooth pairing. Whether this is a quality control issue or something else, I'm unsure. Moreover, the fact that a driver update takes an entire hour is almost inconceivable.","Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023",AH6DM7JGA6NG7D6ZNASFJXSF7MHA,True,5,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,

It is random and occurs even when the phone is close to them. This should not happen. It does not happen often, but it does occur.Otherwise it is worth it. I would still buy them again because they are comfortable and do the job.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2024",AHYHQB6HRDF6QBF3N5R4JTILK3UA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
R2LZQVV3DH0UW5,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser always delivers,Ryan Nguyen,5,"These momentum 4 sound quality is amazing, and they sound good in every single EQ that you decide to use. I really think that Sennheiser has once again delivered a great pair of headphones like they always do. I will listed all of the pros about these headphones.1/ The earcups are spacious and make these very comfortable to wear long hours. However, they tend to heat your ears up but most over ear headphones are like that so I don’t really mind.2/ The hardshell case that comes with these are high quality and will protect your headphones very well. Plus, there are compartments for you to store all the cables and such.3/ Touch Control: I absolutely think that the touch controls on these are absolutely amazing; easy to use and it took me 1 glance at the manual to figure them out. They are quite similar to the Sony WH-1000XM5, but I feel like they are slightly better.4/ ANC: These are top tier noice cancellation (certified by Flossy Carter himself :) ). However, these are not as great as the XM5 so I would say this is a tradeoff between the two. However, their noice cancellation still work great, and I barely hear anything with loud music on.5/ Battery life: Did anyone say 60hrs of battery life? Yes, that’s with ANC turn on!Now for the cons:1/ On ear detection problem: First of all, the on ear detection on these is quite “weird” in a sense that they often don’t work at all. I have tried turning them on and off to no prevail, but they often come back after a while. That’s the only con I could find!Overall: I give these5/5 for sound quality4.5/5 for ANC5/5 for comfort5/5 for personalized EQ4/5 for on ear detection4/5 for valueFinal verdict, totally worth it, and I hope this review has been helpful!","Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2023",AHTFBZJDPVDICQNPLMBL5L2ORFDQ,True,26,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones,
RBAZBP0AEJ7MI,5.0 out of 5 stars A Bargain at this Price point,Theraphosa,5,"I've had these earphones for a month now and I feel like they are the best noise cancelling headphones I have ever owned. My previous ones were an older model Bose and then a comparable Sennheiser.My job requires that I do inspections in various industrial facilites.My initial work is about five hours in an office, but the decibel level is still around 70dB. At that level, the Sony WH-1000XM4 remove about 95% of the ambient noise. Music, computer videos and telephone conversations are excellent. These headphones are very good at that level.I next spend up to four hours inspecting out of the equipment floor. The noise level varies from around 78dB to 82dB. Not painfully loud, but it can cause short term hearing damage in short sessions, but 5hrs/day on a regular basis can permenantly affect your hearing. To give you a reference point, you would have to shout at someone standing about 3ft away for them to understand you. So it's not jet engine loud, but it's uncomfortable and in addition to hearing damage, long term exposure can raise your blood pressure and cause other negative effects on your physical and mental health. And yet, the level at which OSHA requires hearing protection is 85dB.All this is to say that I take sound cancellation seriously, and I also take my music seriously too. These earphones are great on both fronts. I'm very comfortable at work and I can listen to my playlists and don't feel as if I have to turn up the volume to drown out the noise of the machinery. It's really pretty cool.My total shift is about ten hours, and I feel no discomfort wearing these over my ears. I'm also bald, and there is plenty of padding on the band where it contacts the top of my head. I'm very happy with these, and even though I've spent more for earphones, I've never had a better pair for my needs.The only downside is that they are not great when using them to make phone calls in a loud enviroment. I honestly didn't expect them to function great in that respect, but it would have been great if they did.The app has numerous ways to customize your experience. More than I actually use. The adaptive sound kept changing the noise cancellation as I moved, so I turned it off. The Speak to Chat feature could be handy, but I occasionally sing along with my music and it would switch off the cancellation. So I turned that feature off also.PROS:Very comfortable to wear for hours at a time.Very good sound cancellation.Love that they pause the playback when you remove the headphones.Great that just holding a hand over the right ear cup will turn off cancellation so you can have a conversation without removing your earphones.Very good music reproduction. Bass is not quite true, but if it was really pronounced, I could adjust the equalizer.The app is very good and has a lot of features, I was pleasantly surprised even though I don't need or use many of them. It's very helpful.Love the ability to stay connected to two devices at the same time. My phone and my computer work well with the earphones.Cons:Sometimes I wish they were a little more snug (maybe I have a small head?)The app is almost TOO helpful. It can take some trial and error to get everything set up as you like it.I would prefer a more tactile controls. These require that you sweep a finger over the outside of the ear cup for volume and track control. It's actually very accurate, but I would still appreciate something that I could use while wearing gloves.Overall, these are a total win, and a bargain at the price. You could probably get something just a shade better, but it would be at a significantly higher price. These are perfect for me and my situation. I would defintely buy them again.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2024",AGLZUTDNQGTB7SYDWEKICNA7753Q,True,73,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
RN9CWLAVNRL0V,5.0 out of 5 stars Better Than XM5,b,5,"**Disclaimer: I bought mine used like new through AmazonI originally purchased the Sony XM5 because they were soooo highly rated in every article I read. I returned the XM5, got the XM4 and am so much happier. I'll compare the XM4 to the XM5, Apple AirPods Max, and Bose QuietComfort 45 - just to help anyone choosing between them.**Noise Cancellation (4.5/5): the noise cancellation on the XM4 is crazy, almost comparable to the Apple AirPods Max. I gave the XM4 a 4.5 because I still think the Apple AirPods Max have the best noise cancellation, but the Sony XM4 is very close. I also like the fact that you can turn noise cancelling on/off with a button - which is a feature not available with the Bose QuietComfort 45. The noise cancellation is much better than the XM5 and less finicky. An issue with the XM5 is that the noise cancelling would just randomly turn on/off. Like if I paused a video for a little too long, the noise cancellation would just turn off Overall, I wouldn't say I it blocks out all sound, but it's close. I can hear the sound of people talking and music, but it's quieter and I can't make out the words. I definitely can't have a conversation with them on. Also, the XM4 will pick up on when you're talking to people and turn the noise cancelling off for you - but it does make a little announcement when it does that may be annoying or disruptive.**Sound Quality (4/5): the sound quality is great. Way better than the XM5, not as great as the Apple AirPods Max. I think the Apple headphones are just a little crisper. I think it's cool that you can turn 360 sound on, but tbh I never really use it (XM5 also has this feature). The sound is clear, and I haven't experienced any malfunctions/issues with the noise. When I had the XM5, they would just randomly sound muffled (like I was underwater) and, when that wasn't happening, the sound quality was mediocre.**Comfort (5/5): the XM4s are REALLY comfy. I wear glasses with plastic frames and a lot of headphones just don't work and are really uncomfy. The Apple AirPods Max were really uncomfortable with my glasses. Obviously, an easy solution is to just wear contacts, but I hate wearing my contacts for long periods of time - especially, when I study/do work. The XM5 were also pretty comfortable, but wouldn't stay fixed when I adjusted them - they would slip and I would need to readjust them a lot. The XM4 completely cover my ear and the ear pads are soft. They don't squeeze my head the way other headphones do and they don't hurt any part of my ear. I will say that the headband part that rests on top of my head does kind of hurt my head after wearing them for almost 10 hours. Also, I have TMJ so sometimes wearing the headphones does cause my TMJ to flare up and I'll switch to earbuds. But, I think overall these are the most comfortable headphones I have tried.**Product Quality (3.5/5): let's be honest, they're plastic and they feel plastic. They don't feel like super high quality, but let me tell you that they feel way better quality than the XM5 - those felt like a barbie toy. I think the XM4 are sturdy and pretty durable. The Apple AirPods Max are also plastic, but do feel a little more high quality - but also, nothing spectacular.**Aesthetic (3.5/5): If the aesthetic is important to you, I would say they look fine. They're a little bulky, but not terrible. Not as sleek as some others, but they don't look ridiculous. If you're really against a bulky look, then they may not be a great aesthetic match for you. I was worried they would be really clunky, but after getting them and wearing them for a bit, I really don't think they look bad.**Connectivity (4/5): I only have Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, etc.) and I think the connectivity is great with these products! When I got the XM5, they had so many connection issues. I wasn't able to connect them to my laptop, they wouldn't stay connected to my devices - it was a mess. I was really worried I would have the same issues with the XM4, but I have had no problems so far. I will say it was a little odd to have have to download the Sony Connect app and manage the headphone through that platform, but it's user friendly and it's kind of nice to have a control for them (it's almost like a remote).**Battery Life (5/5): The battery life is insane. I've had them for 8 days and have not charged them yet - they still have about 40% charge left. They will turn off automatically to save battery life if you don't use them for a certain amount of time, which I personally like.OVERALL (4.5/5): I think the XM4 are great headphones for a better price than the Apple AirPods Max. The Bose are apparently really similar, but I've never personally tried them. The XM4 is MUCH better than the XM5 in terms of quality and price. They're comfy, great noise cancellation and sound quality, and have great battery life.","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2023",AFWRUIE4QDPQYPQOK3LVEKELRT4A,True,693,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only,
R1RRDWF3JCZOPG,5.0 out of 5 stars What world?,FaTHoM,5,"After buying the WF-10000XM4's and losing the case (replacement is $150. I paid $225 ish for the set), I thought I'd give the WH's a try. I got them for $228 or so, so opted to not get the XM5's due to the price difference. I've only had them for barely a week, but my initial thoughts are certainly positive.Fit. Here's the deal, I have some big ears, with 3/4"" gauges. With my gauges in, I do get some pain in my neck. I have pain issues, so this was no surprise, nor is it a fault of the design. My ears fit fairly comfortably inside the cups to help lock out sound, minus the gauges. The polypropylene(?) material is quite soft and moldable, making wearing them for an hour or more easy and comfortable.I have a kinda funny shaped head (IMO. But I'm highly critical of myself and the world), but these look really slick placed on my dome. I got black, because black goes with everything, and I don't wear color. Look and fit much better than cans I've owned in the past.Noise cancelation. The ANC is good, but not great. I found the ANC on the WF's more thorough, which is a bit odd considering they're earbuds. However, they do form a more legit seal in the ear canal, so it could be that. There is some ""hissing"", but part of that is also my tinnitus. I find that there seems to be some slight hissing even with the ANC off. It's akin to being in a super silent room, and you hear the ""hissing"" from an AV system with it powered on, but with no sound. I've not flown with them yet (Which is a huge reason why I got these), but I assume they'll be just fine for passenger and engine noise.Sound quality. So, I'm pre-burn in on the drivers. There is usually 100 hours or so of burn in on every new speaker/driver on the planet, and these are no different (I have not researched this in actuality. I was in AV for several years, and have some knowledge). But, so far, they sound very pleasant and accurate. I opted for an EQ setting (Excited) just to bring out certain details in the instrumental/electronic music I'm currently listening to. You can hear the trilling of the tongue on a flute, and the fingers against guitar strings. The detail is fairly rich, while maintaining a fairly neutral overall tone. The sounds seem to be reproduced fairly accurately and are fantastic for instrumenal music.For the price I paid, these are great. However, for the normal asking price of around $350, I expect the soundstage and sound field to be superior to what it is. It is evident that you are hearing music played through 2 speakers often times, instead of an amalgamation of speakers 180 degrees in front of you, or listening to a live performance where the sound comes from everywhere. Think of this as 3D sound if you will, similar to Dolby Atmos. I understand they have the real 3d audio whatever, but right out of the box, they should be fully immersive.Battery life/Bluetooth. Battery life seems to be ok with ANC on. I use ANC exclusively because I like to drown out reality while listening, especially during meditation. I suspect you could easily get 8 hours of consistent listening with ANC on before needing to recharge, which is plenty for half the flights on this side of the world (North America). What else can I say about battery life??Bluetooth connectivity is very strong and nearly instant. I can walk from my apartment to my neighbors apartment with my phone in my apartment and still have unbroken connectivity. THAT is freakin awesome.Overall, I'm very pleased with these cans, especially for the price I got them at. At the normal asking price, I'd recommend checking out the XM5's since their so similarly priced. If you're looking for a solid set of cans, and these are on sale, don't mess around, just buy them. You won't be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2022",AEZI5ES3LFYNSNHLSU3EN4T3SC6A,True,141,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R1BHDNEFJ0AW20,5.0 out of 5 stars SONY WH-1000XM4... BEST HEADPHONES EVER,moo,5,"I am coming from a set of Bose QC15 and Sony MDR-7506 and wow!! Hats off to Sony for their MKIV headphones.Sony WH-1000XM4 has incredible sound and features!The active noice cancelling works GREAT!!! I put my head next to the wall AC unit and can barely hear a thing.Compared to my QC15, the Sony is so much better at ANC you'd think the Bose were turned off. Don't get me wrong, I've loved my QC15 on a daily basis for over ten years but comparing these are like night and day.Music from Sony WH-1000XM4 sounds rich and full in a way that I've only heard at a movie theatre and the Bose QC15 and MDR-7506 are no schlubs; I'm used to decent headphones. The custom EQ that you can set and upload to the Sony WH-1000XM4 using their proprietary app is everything. Very intuitive and easy to use and you don't even NEED the app if you just want to use them out of the box and not futz with settings, it can pair like any normal bluetooth device by holding down the power button; however, the app does everything automatically.Compared to AirPods Pro, the ability to tune every feature versus just on/off makes me feel like I have a quality high-end device versus a kind of generic one. Not to get off topic, but I returned the AirPods Pro; they are nice but not for the money. I felt that AirPods Pro FUNCTIONED very very well (Good ANC, brilliant pairing, can use either left, or right, or both, and the auto on/off/pause/play works like a charm) but I thought that they missed the mark on sound quality, comfort, and battery life just enough that I didn't feel that they were worth $200+.Spoiler Alert, I went with Bose QC Earbuds but that's another story.Getting back on topic...The Sony WH-1000XM4 are worth every cent. I scored mine on Prime Day and got a great deal on them!!They're worth MSRP... but try for less. I got them for $75 off MSRP Oct 14, 2020 and they did free next day delivery.There's my obligatory plug, where's my gift card?Oh, right. It was in the box with my headphones, duh. lol. (they gave me a gift card for Prime Day)The thing that surprised me the MOST about the Sony WH-1000XM4 are how well they perform as a headset. Whatever gadgetry they've packed in these is pretty magical. When on a phone call or FaceTime, the headset WHILE KEEPING ANC ACTIVE, makes it so I can hear myself speak and therefore am not shouting while on the phone like I typically am. WHILE ANC IS STILL WORKING. Magical.The auto I/O/Play/Pause feature when you remove them from your head is very nice too.Very happy about multipoint bluetooth. I have it set to work with my iPhone and Sony X950H TV and it's seamless.I was actually waiting for them to upgrade to having this and is why I didn't go for the MKIII. Glad I waited.The case is nice and holds all of the accessories plus a few more tiny ones that I had for other travel things. The case fits perfectly in my laptop bag (Brenthaven Elliot Deluxe) and does not make it any bulkier or bulgy. The case is actually smaller than the one for my QC15 because the Sony WH-1000XM4 fold up! Bonus!!USB-C charging instead of Micro-USB is superb, I am very much enjoying the rapid charge feature and since I plan on having these for a long time, the port is a sturdy one that will take many many many plugging/unpluggings.Battery life seems to function as advertised, although I haven't timed it for 30 hours, I just charge it at the end of the night. If I forget to, no worries, it's charged enough for the day by the time I am done getting ready to go.All in all, very happy with the Sony WH-1000XM4.

R1Z8K8GMOUV106,5.0 out of 5 stars Truly a Worthy Successor to the WH1000xm3!,Bradley,5,"Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried that these headphones would not be the best pair to own after the issues that I experienced with the prior generation of them: the WH1000xm3. The main issue that I had? The build quality: the plastic around the headband snapped due to a flimsy connection, resulting in me having to tape both headbands together so that the headphones don't fall apart on me. I tried several alternate brands to see if they would work, but they never came close to giving me the same level of satisfaction while wearing them as the WH1000xm3 did, even with the taped headband taken into account. So I decided that the best replacement for a Sony headphone was another Sony headphone, and I invested in the M4, which succeeded the M3 last year (as of this writing).My initial thoughts were as follows: the headphones were a definite improvement upon the originals, retaining what I liked most about the original headphones (largely the overall comfort) while also improving the headphones in other small ways (especially in regards to the special features-the M4 are way more feature-packed than the M3 were, incorporating many elements that are being found on most other headphones these days). My favorite thing that was fixed, however, was the sound quality. You see, the original sounded amazing, and honestly sounded better overall than the likes of Bose and Sennheiser, which I have tested as potential replacements for the Sony headphones. And that is despite the fact that the headphones have a relatively small 40mm driver inside, instead of a more traditional 50mm driver. However, the one minor issue I had with the M3 was that the low frequencies were heightened a bit more than I would have liked, making songs sound a bit bass-heavy even when the EQ was turned off (the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the EQ to 'bright', which isn't ideal since the EQ does degrade the battery life). With the M4, Sony improves this by tuning down the low ends, resulting in the headphones having a very flat frequency response, which in turn results in every song having a much wider sound stage than the M3 did (and almost making them sound as good as the various open-back headphones I have tried, including the Sennheiser 650, which is my personal favorite open-back headphone).In terms of the special features, I think they were implemented quite well in these headphones. The noise cancelling is exceptional, much like it was on the M3, and the transparency mode is somehow even better than it was on the prior generation headphone, sounding a lot more natural and less tinny overall. The auto activation of transparency mode during conversations is fantastic, and enables me to talk to people naturally without ever having to remove the headphones from my ear. This also means that I don't have to awkwardly tap my hand on the earcup with the M4, either. The DSEE Extreme audio enhancer really helps to make music sound a lot more full, even when using devices that don't support the LDAC wireless standard. It isn't as good as listening to lossless files wired, mind you, but it is still an amazing feature that helps to take advantage of the flat sound stage and frequency response of the headphone drivers.Now, this isn't to say that these headphones don't have issues, mind you. The auto-pause when removing the headphones from your ears is very much a gimmick, and doesn't always pause the song (and may even resume the music before you have a chance to place the headphones back on your ear). Since the headphones use a light sensor to tell if you are wearing your headphones or not, it means even a simple shadow can cause the headphones to think that they are back on your ears and restart music playback. It is quite obnoxious, and it is best left out. Another, more minor issue is the touch controls. While I personally have no issue with them, I know that there are many people that don't like them whatsoever. So I will just make a note that they are still here, and they work in much the same way as they did on the M3. Finally, I should mention that the flat soundstage, while amazing for my listening experience, may not be for everyone. Bassheads in particular would likely prefer extra pronunciation on the lower ranges. And while they will never be quite as bass-heavy as the Skullcandy or Beats line, the EQ can still bring the bass levels up quite a bit, using a 'clear bass' slider that reminds me of the slider on the Skullcandy Skullcrushers: raising the bass without causing distortion.Overall, the headphones turned out to be quite an exceptional pair, especially when it comes to listening to music during commutes. The great noise cancelling, beautiful audio, and fantastic transparency mode definitely make these headphones a winner in my book. And the app only helps to improve the flexibility of the headphones, allowing for many different features to be unlocked. And while these headphones certainly have some issues (no pair of headphones are perfect, after all), I think the benefits more than outweigh the issues for me, and put these at the top of my list of best closed-back headphones that I have worn. Hopefully Sony will continue to make amazing headphones like these in the ears to come.","Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2021",AFKIZZFUQDOWZ72ZQFX6UJBSPDCQ,True,150,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only,
R38T61DMMWO74Q,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sony WH-1000XM4 vs. Bose 700 vs. Jabra Evolve2 65, mostly for Zoom meetings",Michael23,4,"I was looking for headphones for work and personal usage. I did a lot of research and it was clear that there was no one model that was best at everything. So, I prioritized what I was looking for (in rough order):1) physical comfort (nothing else really matters if they're painful to wear)2) blocking out outside noise (household noise, cars passing by, leaf blowers, etc.)3) technical ease (i.e., easily connecting to both my phone and laptop)4) microphone quality (for phone calls and Zoom)5) sound quality for music (I tested with EDM and IDM music)6) cost (I was willing to pay more for quality as long as it wasn't outrageous)7) battery life (not really important to me as long as it gets through the workday)After a lot of reading, I narrowed it down to five:Bose 700Sony WH-1000XM4Jabra Evolve2 65Jabra 85HJabra Evolve 75And I ultimately ordered the top 3.Here's my review:Sony WH-1000XM4:- This was the clear winner for me: most comfortable, best at blocking out outside noise, excellent music quality, and easy to use- I appreciate how it automatically adjusts the noise canceling settings based on activity (sitting still, walking, etc.), and I had no trouble connecting it to my phone and computer at the same time- The biggest downside (other than the high price) is that it was definitely the worst microphone of the three. People on the other end were able to understand me, but when I listened to recordings it definitely sounded more muffled and less clear than with the other two headphonesthough its microphone quality isn't great- It's probably also worth mentioning that my brother tried these on and he found them uncomfortable because he has large ears, whereas the Bose 700 felt fine for himBose 700:- This was a close runner-up: good at blocking outside noise, comfortable enough (but I felt it squeezing my head more than the Sony), and good music quality (I even preferred it to the Sony for some songs, though in general I felt like the instruments were somehow a bit further away or flat compared to the Sony)- It gave me just a little trouble to connect to phone and computer at once but it was fine once I got it set up the first time- The microphone was noticeably better than the Sony's but still not greatJabra Evolve2 65:- Surprisingly good music quality given its purpose as more of an office headset; but, given its protruding microphone arm, I was expecting significantly better mic quality than the other two when in fact I only found it to be a little better than the Bose- Fairly comfortable, but I preferred the way that the other two completely enclosed my ears rather than just squeezing against them as the Jabra did- Setup was easy and I appreciated the USB dongle to wirelessly connect it without fiddling with BluetoothSOME TAKEAWAYS:- Ultimately, I learned that all of these have pretty bad microphones, so you'll need to get a dedicated microphone if you really care about recording sound quality- This is of course personal preference, but I still find my Jabra Elite Sport earbuds from 2018 to be more comfortable than all of these, and they surprisingly had just as good or better microphone quality than all of these fancier larger headphones. I'm able to wear the Sony or the Bose headphones for a few hours, but my ears still feel a bit tender when I take them off- I was quite surprised that the active noise canceling was fine for me on both the Bose and the Sony. I had tried a previous Bose model years ago and experienced a lot of painful pressure on my ears, so I was quite happy to discover that I rarely experienced that here. I'm not sure if the tech has just gotten better or if I've acclimated somehow, but consider giving the Bose or Sony a try even if you've had trouble with this in the pastDECISION:I ended up choosing the Sony WH-1000XM4, which are in most ways the best headphones I've ever used (with important caveats below). When I started my search, my top priority was how well they worked for Zoom calls. Music quality was a secondary concern. But after spending weeks with these headphones, I'm pretty blown away by how my music sounds, like new dimensions have been opened up. I recommend them, along with the Wavelet smartphone app for AutoEq equalization tuned to these headphones specifically. However, there are two glaring flaws you should know about:1) The microphone quality really isn't great. When I'm in Zoom meetings, I set it to use my laptop's built-in microphone instead since it sounds better.2) It does pair well with my laptop and smartphone at once. But, there are some quirks that are extremely annoying. Whenever one of the two disconnects, a voice loudly announces, ""Bluetooth device disconnected."" So, say I'm listening to music on my phone or on a phone call—if my laptop falls asleep or I turn it off, my music or call will be interrupted with that useless announcement. Even worse, whenever you answer a phone call, it disconnects momentarily from the computer, so as soon as your phone call begins it makes that loud announcement and you miss the first few seconds of your call.Yes, you heard that right: If your laptop is on and the headphones are connected to it and your smartphone (which is supposed to be one of the best features), then every time you answer the phone the first few seconds of the call will be interrupted.So that's why it loses one star. But truly, the music quality and noise-canceling are so great that I really like them anyway and am willing to work around this limitation. I sure wish Sony would release a firmware update though allowing us to disable that voice completely!","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2021",AHYELS2PGI2XCI3HB3O5UDG3JQUQ,True,38,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R1U65T3UFWZLG4,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product, Great Customer Service - Best Overall Headphones",Lio,5,"Customer Service: 5/5I purchased this item on Amazon through the seller Focus Camera.The pair I received had a volume defect that effected one side of the headphones constantly making it louder. After some firmware updates and messing with EQ, it was apparent that this was a manufacturer issue. However, when I went to try to initiate the return Amazon was only giving me the option of a full refund when I wanted an exchange. I then reached out to the seller who initiated an exchange for me without any further questions asked - In fact, I was surprised to have the shipping label in their initial reply.Product: 5/5Now that I have a new functioning unit, I can say these are some of the best all-around headphones available right now.As an Apple AirPods Pro user - and like many of you - I was discouraged at the price of Apple’s first branded headphone. No matter the quality, many of us can’t justify that price.I’ve been looking for a pair of wired-headphones for gaming use, video editing use (wired-in editing is the best for sound editing precision), and of course casual music listening use.As far as features, the gesture controls have worked accurately for me and I’ve welcomed the volume control which isn’t a feature on AirPods/AirPods Pro. Their companion app with built in EQ and detailed setting is a God-send for us Apple users who want more customization options in their products. The battery is as long as advertised and it’s nice knowing you don’t have to charge them daily (with my use). Speak-to-Chat is a great idea that has some real-world use cases. Noise Cancellation is probably the best in this mid-tier range of headphones. But if listening to your surroundings is most important to you be aware that the microphones used to listen to your environment - “Ambient Sound” Mode - seem to be located near the top of each headphone can and this appears to face up, as a result the ambient mode is not as effective as Apple’s AirPods Pro’s Transparency Mode (which I’ll assume that the same quality extends to the AirPods Max). The AirPods replicate your surrounding sounds perfectly in real-life quality as if you didn’t have anything in/on your ears. So big FYI; Apple is still king in “Transparency/Ambient” modes. Lastly, they’re extremely comfortable although your ears might get a little warm from the leatherette after prolonged use.I think price is important when considering the review of anything because it determines value. I bought these on sale for $278. With the price being so close to Apple AirPods Pro at $250, I personally feel I’m getting more than my money’s worth with a travel case, 3.5mm audio cable, charging cable, and airplane audio adapter all included with the cost at a great deal. These have a retail price of $350. So, given all of the above and the sound quality, I wouldn’t be particularly enthused or feeling like I got a great deal if I paid full-price for them but the convenience and rich sound make it a good investment nonetheless and almost all owners will be happy with them. But, I hope you understand that that means if these are on sale (especially for $250) then don’t even think about it. It’s a no-brainer Purchase them right away if you see them on sale!Lastly: Sound - The sound is great and highly customizable but the headphones themselves seem to lean towards warmer tones and more bass. Don’t worry, they’re not maxed out like the early-model Beats, but I recommend each user download their companion app and try EQ for the perfect balance. As long as you are aware that these aren’t the audiophile headphones for mixing professional music or films, nor the pair of workout/gym headphones, nor even the pair with noise cancellation that will make you sound like you’re in a soundproof room - then you’ll be happy. These headphones will not excel in any of these specific features, but that’s what makes these headphones the best over-all headphones. It’s a jack-of-all trades and so far one of my favorite Sony products ever made. I hope you enjoy yours as I’ve enjoyed mine.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2021",AFPLI4FFCUNPV4VG7D7ZEEUI3OPQ,True,11,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R8H3J5IAMVQYO,5.0 out of 5 stars My review is effectively these should be xm 3.1 not 4 build but good otherwise.,s,5,"about the same as the xm3. the pairing aspect is nice and was my reason to upgrade. I couldn't take all the paring issues anymore, and having more control in my phone to move between all my computers was appreciated.The app does only pair to 2 devices, but it keeps a memory or list of the devices you have paired to (it is not easy to find this information online). I should probably make some youtube video. Having this management aspect makes these so much more usable. They should back-port this to xm3 as well even if only one device at a time software control is so helpful. I''m in software and have to switch computers and phones a lot.Otherwise, i the anc is superior to xm3, mildly so. For me the reason to upgrade is if you want excellent multiparing. Frankly it seems to just work better. Even single paring for me was always dicey on the xm3 there are some devices it just wouldn't pair with. Not the case with these. The sound and anc aren't really reasons to upgrade. they all sound fantastic.The lacking issue is still build quality. they look nice, but the qc 25/35 which i also own use metal in the hinges and i am certain will last longer from a build standpoint. I 've pretty much taken the xm3 apart, they are all plastic, and you better be careful. That said these are so easy to work on. I have opened up my xm3's replaced the battery and pads and they are still going strong at almost 3 years now. I upgraded because i literally use these every day, i actually sleep in them and the multiparing was wearing on me. Given how much they are used it was worth it for me.As long as these sony continue to make great anc headphones, and keep them serviceable i'll continue to go sony. The tipping point is the sound vs bose. Don't get me wrong bose gets a really bad rep in my opinion. They are not bad in any way and still have better build quality and calls. sure they are a bluetooth headphone. I have high end stuff too they don't have that kind of detail. But you know what. These are the headphones i used. I don't especially like being tethered to a computer. Anyway with bose the sound just isn't as fun. For me when you using headpones with small speakers, you to tune warm unlike large receiver speakers. I could even say if your a bit older losing your ability to detect highs maybe then bose makes sense, or your tastes are more for a flat neutral. the sound bose is good. However that's isn't me at all if i want that i'll have a chat with my wife. I don't want boomy but i do want a warm sound that's exciting. these are the best sounding bluetooth headphones with ANC i 've heard and they are plenty good enough for me. I will pretty much continue to live in my xm4 now at my desk and when i am out use my xm3s. By the way i picked these on verizon for some insane deal. They were like 250 already. I'd wait for black friday. i was going to, but then that came up. 350's a lot for this build quality, but if you haven't used these and are on the fence amazon is good because of the return policy if you don't like them. I really do think this is one of those rare great products, and i have had so much use out of my xm3. the pause /turn off when take off is also wonderful. I had that on my plantronics and am glad they added that here. The speak to chat feature is also nice. I like the low sensitivity mode.I have ultimately decided good anc is so worth it. I have way lower stress. Just the other day i was working at home, and there is all this construction going on i didn't even notice it, and i could see how stressed out my wife was. I also have kids and dogs, I put these things on and I am like a bachelor. I use them everywhere card, yard worksconcentration, sleep. It's just fantastic technology. Even if your working out and you are on some loud exercise equipment you can use these and save your ears and hear the tv. They aren't waterproof, but i just put on a fan when i am working out to prevent sweating and that works great. I am also glad they aren't water proof so i can easily replace the battery for 15 dollars. It has a freaking plug and doesn't even need to be soldered. xm4 is the same. Get these. :)","Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2020",AH53ZBSOM7ZRSWR6RACMNAE32SZQ,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R3D4YJSFPEC0YM,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise cancelling, bluetooth range, sound very good, comfortable, horrible user controls",TechPicky,4,"A disclaimer: I received this product as part of Amazon’s Vine program. While I didn’t pay for the item, the review is totally my personal, unbiased review. Neither Amazon, nor the vendor has influenced this review in any way.ProsExcellent noise cancellingVery good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)Battery lifeExcellent Bluetooth rangeAutomatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency modeConsTouch controls are simply awful!Dual Bluetooth device supportConstant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with “Detection of Actions” enabledVoice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make. A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.Rubs on the “helix” outer part of the ear on the left earSomewhat complex set up processOverall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones. The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent. This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available. The Bluetooth range is also exceptional. Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone. They have long battery life and charge quickly. They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful. There are many other features with a range of benefit.Comfort:They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush. However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.) If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses. They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously. The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time. I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones. I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app. I was then able to play music from the MacBook. I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something. It didn’t immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky. Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch. Mostly it doesn’t if something is playing already on one device. Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isn’t played – so it goes no where. This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35. I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesn’t speak the name of the device. It will say “Bluetooth device 1 connected,” whereas the Bose QC35 will speak “Joe’s iPhone.” Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesn’t always refer to the same device. Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2. The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app. This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices. It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices. You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device. You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected. You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.Bluetooth range is excellent. It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another. The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.Sound Quality:Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent. For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones. Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable. Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response. More so they sound “warm.” The bass is noticeable, and quite deep. You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight. The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies. Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified. Male and female vocals sound good and natural.The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment. These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment. High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences. I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones. They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier. That really isn’t a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth. The difference wasn’t as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth. I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones. They didn’t sound that different, which is rather a good thing. The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound. Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good. Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet. This isn’t as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS. You can’t simply use a high-resolution source to use it. You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play. I’m not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better. To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.I did try the DSEE Extreme feature. This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content. I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music. It sounded different, I’m not sure I would say it sounded better. At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies. It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable. This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used. The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal. I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup. I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasn’t like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic. There was some front/rear placement depth. It was interesting to play with for a while. What I found though is that it just sounded strange. I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical. Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable. It doesn’t replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above. Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks. Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical. By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.Phone callsThe audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations. With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls. They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.Phone call microphone:Overall I’ve had only a few complaints from those that I’ve in meetings or on calls with. Most people said I sounded fine. I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone. They said I sounded “far away.” On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as “bubbly.” After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I haven’t had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19. This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I don’t know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but aren’t great.Noise cancellationThese are fantastic at noise cancellation. I haven’t been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35. At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call. My neighbor’s air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these. I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these. I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring! Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music. I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane. Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose don’t work nearly as well, especially for voice. They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I haven’t tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I don’t notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.Battery:Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls). These definitely exceed the rated battery life. With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use. I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge. Sony doesn’t specify any longer battery life with the wired cable. On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isn’t fantastic. It is more than enough though. It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use. Almost any other use it should be more than enough. I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.Charging:These charge with a USB-C connector. They come with a very short (about 6”) USB-A to C cable but no power supply. They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didn’t time it). You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging. I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity. They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power. In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick. It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.User interface:This is the worst aspect of these headphones. The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable. Simple buttons would have been much better. Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesn’t register the touch, or it does the wrong thing. You try and turn the volume down and track changes. To be fair, they do have a volume control. The Air Pods Pro don’t and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls don’t work right.Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen won’t work right. Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume. Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume. Hitting the start stop button doesn’t seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call – be careful of that. I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times. Simple buttons would have been SO much better.Voice assistant:Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device. It will then want to pair with Bluetooth. I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt. If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app). You could just say Alexa and it worked. You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would. It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app. The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though. This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content. It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume. Telling Alexa to play won’t resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems. This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better. It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google). I haven’t tried other voice assistants with these yet.The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying. At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard. This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode. While you still can’t hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesn’t take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode. This mostly works. In the automatic mode it doesn’t need to actually be voice that triggers it. Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode. There is a low sensitivity mode that I haven’t tried yet. You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while. Even with the “Focus on Voice” feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.Another feature is adaptive sound control. This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions. This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc. I haven’t evaluated that during a pandemic.As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying. It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didn’t know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions. This can be disabled in the app. If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well. (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!) AppThe app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones. Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual. The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more. You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears. I went through the whole process.There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK. It can be a bit confusing.The app does provide a lot of control and information. It shows battery level, and the current codec in use. This last part I really like, Apple typically doesn’t show these details. Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.Case, accessoriesA nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35. It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system. The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling. It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.","Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2020",AE7DZ3XTVG6DTUFU2KBE52MDPL4A,True,576,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R2RUMUO1GMQ7JX,3.0 out of 5 stars Not everything I ever dreamed of...,Andrew Cousineau,3,"I spent more on these headphones than I ever have on a pair of headphones before, so I was hoping that on top of the normal duties of a pair of headphones, that they would also wash my dishes and walk my dog for me ect. To be fair, they are probably the best headphones I've ever owned (which they should be as they're like double the price of the last 'expensive' pair I bought), but they didn't really wow me either.The noise cancelling and sound quality is generally fine. I'm a bassist, so if the bass is emphasized, I'm happy. I don't really notice the bass to be particularly heavy. I can usually distinctly hear bass lines if I make a conscious effot, but they don't tend to overpower (which I prefer, but I know a lot of people don't). I haven't messed around with the equalizer much so I can't speak to that. My issue with the sound quality is in the ambient sound mode. The ambient sound mode makes the ambient sounds sound horrible. This is largely my first experience with noise cancelling, so I don't have anything to compare it to, maybe we just don't have the tech yet to amplify sounds and not make them sound tinney and horrible. But yeah, it legit sounds like I'm listening to the world through a tin can. As a result I rarely use the ambient sound mode (this mode has noise cancelling but allows for some noises to come through) and rather just use the noise cancelling mode when I want to be aware of my surroundings.These headphones have several annoying features that if I knew I'd dislike so much I would've gone for another pair of headphones. First, the touch controls. Apparently there are some people out there who like the touch controls, but are they really necessary when buttons exist? Touch controls only make sense when there is a screen you can look at or at least some sort of tactile cue that reassures you that you're doing the thing you want to be doing. The two most important functions (on/off, and sound cancelling level) are controlled by real buttons, but pause, skip, and volume are all controlled by touch controls on the outside surface of the right headphone. Unless you are sitting perfectly still these are pretty much impossible to use and can result in unwanted pauses and skips. The #1 time I wear these is when I walk/run my dog. I cannot use the touch controls when I'm running and can occasionally use them while I'm walking, but they tend to be very imprecise. So to turn up the volume I have to do the motion like 3 times until I accidentally skip the song instead. This isn't a rare problem where most of the time I can use them fine. This happens the vast majority of times I try to use the touch controls when I'm moving - I'm actually pleasantly surprised if I can do the correct gesture while walking. Some people may argue that I have failed to learn how to use the touch controls (I've had these headphones for 6+ months), but there really shouldn't be a learning curve for being able to pause music - this is a design failure.I also wear these to the gym quite often. The other problem that I have with the touch controls is that I cannot do any sort of exercise with my arms overhead (pull ups, overhead press, ect.) with these on because my shoulder will touch the outside surface and pause or skip. I usually end up taking them off for my set.So, if you're the least bit hesitant about the touch controls, I'd say check out your other options because if I knew they'd be this frustrating I would've bought different headphones.The second overall problem I have with these headphones is how much talking they do. So you'd think, turn them on and play music, right? No, its turn them on, it says ""Power on"". Then it tells you ""Bluetooth connected"" - cool, good to know I can now turn on my music and listen... Unless I have a second device nearby and it says ""Bluetooth second device connected"". Then (because I'm walking my dog away from my second device) it plays a sound to tell me that device has been disconnected. Then I change the noise cancelling level... ""Ambient sound"" which sounds bad so I press the button again... ""Ambient Sound control off"". The robot talks so damn slow, it's literally like a minute of messing around before I can just listen to my music. Y'all really couldn't abbreviate any of this or make it talk faster? And if I want to change the noise cancelling level while listening to music or a podcast I best pause the song otherwise I'll miss half of it listening to the robot tell me what I know I'm doing and can hear the difference between. This is all a bit of an exaggeration, but it's enough to frustrate me. For a $300 pair of headphones I think I have the right to be impatient.Another minor thing that might not actually be the fault of the headphones is they have trouble with certain apps. Sometimes I'll press play on my phone but it won't play through the headphones for like 10 seconds or sometimes more (which is enough time to make me think something is wrong). Again, the headphones could be innocent here - they tend to work fine with the Apple Music app, but not the Apple Podcast app. I'm leaning towards blaming the app.Also the headphones generally comfy to wear. I have a small head, and they can fall off if I'm laying down but its not a huge issue.Overall, these are good headphones, but they have some design choices that make the headphones annoying to use which is frustrating for the price. If these break I won't buy another pair and would likely look for ones that don't have touch control, but I didn't think these issues were enough of a problem to get a refund or anything.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AHVIBRANSX6ITQCAF6SA5XNMQNAA,True,1,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only,
R17KWZY74P83HQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Very Solid For Out-of-Office,Jason Brannock,4,"I left a lengthy review of the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. Since that review is out there, I'll reduce this one only to E285 and SX4.Microphone and PlaybackThe E285 was notably better than the SX4, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. It’s neck and neck as far as clarity of voice goes.Akin to the E285, the SX4 are quite good as far as pick-up goes. But unfortunately, they were a little too good (or simply worse at distinguishing background noise). A co-worker and I had a Zoom meeting with ourselves in the same closet (to maximize productivity), switching between the headsets. Whoever had the E285 could hear themselves through the headset. At first, I thought it was because of the function where you hear yourself through the headset. But alas, upon one of us leaving the room, the echo went away. This meant the SX4 was picking up the other’s voice! The main killer of the SX4 is that you have no way to mute yourself from the headset. As a pair of headphones to be used in the office, this is crucial. You never know when someone may decide to butt in your closet (or office, for most people) and shout “HHHHEEEYYYY!!”. In contrast, the E285 offers two ways to protect yourself from such intrusions – by raising the boom arm or by pressing the button on the boom arm, leaving you to look down simply in resignation at said co-worker without having disrupted the meeting. The one drawback with the E285 is that sometimes the first word or two don’t quite make it through, so you may develop a stutter of your introduction. “I’m Jason – oh – I’M JASON – oh you can hear me now? I’m Jason”. Good news is, you shan’t be soon forgotten. Despite this, it’s more favorable than not being able to mute myself, though I can understand disagreement with this point. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophileBoth associated apps come with decent equalizers (unlike Bose). Honestly, it was difficult to tell the difference between the E285 and SX4. I think the amount of bass you get is comparable, however I think the SX4 is capable of producing an ever-so-slightly louder sound. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.BrandJabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!Sony: same as Jabra, though with a caveat. The SX4 offers more utility when given Location permission, which will be addressed later on. They were not pertinent to me, however, so my location remains an enigma for Sony and Jabra (and Bose). Tie between E285 and SX4.ANCWhen playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. The E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it’s just higher frequencies) than the other headsets, though the SX4 is perfectly satisfactory.In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. It almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). The SX4 has essentially the same feature, with an added “Focus on voice” option. I couldn’t tell a difference when that was on/off. Besides that, the SX4 didn’t do as good a job at allowing sound through as the E285. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.ConnectivityThe E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. Unfortunately, I don't remember specifics about the SX4. SX4 and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard “add device”, etc. One annoying thing about the SX4 is you have to use the app to establish a Bluetooth connection to another device. Not a big deal, but for comparison’s sake, the E285 is better. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.Response time: The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I’ve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn’t resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC. So SX4 is better about ear detection (presumably because it's laser-assisted).App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.Voice AssistantThe E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it’s pointless). Tie between E285 and SX4.ControlsOn the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. Muting is done with the E285 by simply raising or lowering the boom mic. In contrast, the SX4 doesn't have any way to mute yourself.After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.Comfort and StyleComfort is pretty much a tie between E285 and SX4. I've worn both for hours and hours without any issue. But I prefer the style of the SX4 - it just feels more premium. Winner is SX4. Runner up is E285.ExtraThe E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.IssuesThere’s some variability with functionality of the Google Assistant with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars, same as the SX4. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. I can't say the same for the SX4 since it was ultimately returned. I ended up choosing the E285 over the SX4 because it has an edge when it comes to office use, for one main reason - you can't mute yourself on the SX4. But if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2021",AGM4GFRMZNI3U2WHNRS734VKMZRA,True,66,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R709TK5SYB7PC,4.0 out of 5 stars Mostly great,Whirlaway,4,"UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out. Based on this experience so far, I'm raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars. Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about). I'm not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.I now believe the ""bluetooth stopping for no reason"" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better. As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes. As a practical matter, this means you can't sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off. I've wound up disabling this feature.Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable. The only reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)UPDATED: I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy. Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all). At other times, there are skips or pops. While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.PROS:1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose. They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file. When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world. I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing. A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have. It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a ""feature"" of ANC headphones.2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used. The ear pieces in particular are outstanding. I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable. However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable. These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on. I can comfortably wear these for hours.3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well. I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.CONS:1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either). The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music. Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue. I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file. I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it. It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason. For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.2) Phone call quality -- meh. Some calls are good, others not so much. Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality. However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc. Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better. I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on. However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.). It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones. However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have. I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2020",AGY3FKXCB7VCVYWXHL4MLDKIBUUQ,True,36,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
RJE80FBWZNCH6,5.0 out of 5 stars Mind blowing noise cancellation,Hugo Stiglitz,5,"The noise cancellation is insane. The first time i turned them on i couldnt believe it. I was used to pretty weak NC, and these are supposed to be the best. What a differenceOne thing i hadnt thought of is that noise cancellation actually does make a big difference to sound quality while previously i didnt think it was that important. But because it gives you an almost silent environment, everything sounds better.I also love that it has LDAC support. The transmission rate is automatic and unfortunately rarely uses the highest quality, but you can force it with developer options on any android phone (look up a guide to do that). The connection is perfect on the lower settings and you can go 100ft away from your phone and itll still work fine. Its only at the highest setting that theres any issues, but IMO its still worth using if you have high res audio files. Its near indistinguishable from the sound quality of a wired connection at the point (and assuming youre not in a totally silent envionment with NC off.TThe only weak point is the frequency response, but its also personal preference. Its balanced but bass heavy which a lot of people like. I don't. In my opinion it should be more neutral.When audio professionals mix and master music, they already put in as much bass as they can (in modern music) so there's no need for headphones to add even more. They know what theyre doing so it makes no sense to me to try and ""enhance"" what doesnt need to be ""enhanced""Unfortunately most consumers think more bass = better so headphone makers aren't afraid to add more than is necessary especially when other manufacturers add a ton, meaning if you don't as well people might say your product has weak bass, which isn't the case at all","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AF2WNSSZUVLPCMWGE7LNOXZTLGPQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R2USDO6PGSXOSG,"2.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, good NC...multipoint Bluetooth FAIL!",John,2,"I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II. I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later). The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II. However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.Sound: A-First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II. Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy. With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great. A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality. The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi. Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback. However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.Noise cancelling: A-When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling. It wasn't present with the XM3. I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4. I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely. The XM3 still has some leakage. The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better. The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.Multipoint Bluetooth: FThis was the feature I had been waiting for. The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once. FAIL! I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4. I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed. Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated. So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth. Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless. This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device. However, the way it manages connections is very poor. I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer. If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound. Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio. I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play. If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless. With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode. They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed. So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3. I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them. With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it. But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet. At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for. I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.Comfort: ACompared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on. The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.Controls: BI totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls. Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead. It's a small annoyance. On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.In-call: DOne thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking. Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it. If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on. Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated. Super slow and awkward and unusable. So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak. When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day. Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone. I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them. I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this. Fail.Auto-mute: FSony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking. Nice in concept - terrible in practice. I just turned it off and left it off. If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time. So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening. What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying. So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.Miscellaneous:I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone. With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot. It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching. The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable. I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great. Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones. This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones. How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use? It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.Conclusion:All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product. If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it. The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3. Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering. The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3. In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark. I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones. As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back. Sadly, they are not as advertised.","Reviewed in the United States September 19, 2020",AFDEU4TPM7P7QRC7HKAXHD4O5L3Q,True,41,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R1KYYRPR3VE2DG,4.0 out of 5 stars Get these...at the right price,H. Ricks,4,"I got these as a 2023 Christmas upgrade from the XB-900. I loved their sound quality (especially the bass of the XB-900), but it lacked conveniences that made it difficult to use those on a regular basis (being that I'm in the Apple ecosystem (iPhone/iPad/Mac and Apple TV). When they were around 30% off, it was a no-brainer.The ANC is still great. They may not be on the level of AirPods Max, but they're just as good as the XM-500's. The sound quality is more 'balanced,' so while you don't get massive bass (like the XB series, Skullcrusher or Sony Ult), they can keep up.But my favorite aspects, coming from the XB900's, are its ability to multi-pair between 2 devices. It was frustrating to have to go through a process just to switch devices. Granted, you have to use the app to enable them between devices, but that's still better than having to go into bluetooth settings and unpair, then re-pair.Also, I like the play/pause gesture feature that weren't on the XB900. While it wasn't that much of a biggie (be it tap the cup to pause or pause on the app or device), it felt more natural to just take them off for it to pause your media. And, unlike some of Apple's offerings, I like that you can create your own EQ settings than their stock settings.While it took some time to modify the settings for ANC/pass-through (based on work/home/travel environments), the experience when using is great.Overall...the XM-400's are as good as the newer 'flagship' XM500 (almost forgot: they fold better...be around your neck or case). You're getting great sound, great ANC, great battery life, decent build (albeit plastic) and great customization. But if you get these when on sale (especially around or under $230), you're getting a premium device at a 'Goldilocks' price!My 3 cents...","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AH34Y7RKTMJ47UGXWZPX25J3JMZQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,

R28ULTR4EVN00O,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but be aware of quirks and limitations",T. Apuzzo,4,"UPDATE 11/11/20: With the release of firmware 2.0.7 these have become usable for conference calls on Windows 10. The issue with initial syllables getting cut-off appears to be fixed and overall I have reports when using Skype and Zoom from my co-workers is that I now sound as good as (or maybe even a bit better than) other co-workers using Bose NC 700 headphones. According to Sony's release notes this firmware update is only supposed to address connection stability on Windows. I have increased my rating to 4 stars.UPDATE 10/30/20: No update from Sony on the microphone issue. My co-worker have asked that I use a different microphone as the microphone audio is quite poor. I'm outside the Amazon return window, but am currently working with Sony to hopefully get these at least exchanged if not returned.UPDATE: After a week, I am getting many complaints from people on the other end of my conference calls. Zoom / WebEx / etc. This is a serious issue that impacts me on a daily basis. I have put a case into Sony support and hoping they release a new firmware soon to fix the call quality.Below is my ""evergreen"" review which I will update whenever I have revised my opinion of these phones due to either new experiences or updated firmware, etc.Compared to my 2 year old Sony WH-H900N:Pros:+ More equalization options, including the ability to use the EQ with LDAC codec.+ Stronger ANC, particularly high-pitched whines and voices are significantly more attenuated by the XM4. Airplane or fan noise is not hugely different. Overall the ANC on the XM4 is superior.+ True multipoint connectivity allows you to connect the XM4 to two different devices simultaneously. Both AD2P and HSP profiles can be simultaneously connected to 2 different devices. The H900N can independently connect their AD2P and HSP profiles to two different devices which can allow music to be played on a PC while using a phone for voice calls, but it is tricky to connect/disconnect the correct profiles each time you power cycle the headphones. The XM4 are much improved on this front, although the priority switching is a bit dodgy in my opinion and takes a few seconds to detect and switch devices, so it's easy to miss notifications or other brief sounds when multiply connected.+ The XM4 are better for making calls in noisy environments, although the overall quality is mediocre at best. Any halfway decent gaming headset or office headset will do a better job of capturing just your voice. I tested versus my Sennheiser G4ME One wired headset.+ (slightly) more compact travel case since the earcups both swivel and fold whereas the H900N only fold+ XM4 allows you to mix in a variable amount of ambient sound whereas the H900N has only 1 setting for ambient sound+ The WH-1000XM4 while improved, are still poor in windy situations, even when put into ""wind"" mode, which does help. I haven't had a chance to compare the XM4 on a voice call in windy environments. The H900N are unusable in wind for phone calls, I have to switch to the handset.Cons:- The WH-1000XM4 have significantly less Bluetooth 4.0 range, I get crackling and break-up within 3 meters where the WH-H900N easily reach 10 meters. This is a big deal when working from home. With the H900N I could make a phone call from the kitchen with my computer in the office and be pretty confident that I could still speak and hear everything. With the XM4 I can't leave my office without huge glitching. EDIT: I swapped out my BT4.0 adapter to a BT5.0 adapter on my desktop and with this, I can get ~20 meter range with my XM4, still not quite as good as the H900N gets with BT4, but acceptable for my uses.- Overall, WH-1000XM4 do not sound much better, in fact at default factory settings, the midrange is a bit muffled and bass response bloated versus older headphones, tweaking Clear Bass setting to -2 helps- The WH-1000XM4 ANC presents a low-level background hiss and a sucking sensation on the ears- The WH-1000XM4 do not support Qualcomm aptx codecs- The WH-1000XM4 have worse microphone quality when used in quiet environments.- Hold-hand-to-right-earcup-to-speak actually works better on the older headphones as Sony apparently wants you to use the deeply problematic speak-to-chat automatic feature insteadEqual:* Battery life is roughly the same, with ~24 hours for the older headphones versus ~30 hours for the newer* Bluetooth pairing is similarly slow on both headphones* Both support LDAC codec for high bitrate sound (although when in 2-device mode LDAC cannot be used)* Overall weight and comfort is similar, with the XM4 being a bit lighter* Ear heat is a problem with both headphones, slightly cooler on the XM4* Neither headphone can use the microphone when listening via wired connection, come on Sony!* Neither headphone can be used as a USB headset (even though the phones are recognized by Windows 10, they do not show up as an audio device)* Touch controls are essentially identical, in fact the H900N are actually a bit more responsive although perhaps I'll get used to the XM4Personal Preference:* The style of the older headphones is a bit nicer in my opinion, and they are available in more colors* The newer XM4 use USB-C charging versus micro-usb for the older headphones. This should be a pro for the XM4 but the XM4 won't charge on any of my USB-C PD chargers, so I have to either plug them into a port on my computer or find an old low-power phone charger to charge them. The H900N are less finicky about what charger they will accept.* The ""silver"" XM4 is really a grayish-beige which is pretty ugly, I wish I'd have bought boring basic black.Overall I am disappointed that these are not a bigger upgrade over my 3 year old headphones. I knew from various reviews that the H900N sounded better than the 1000XM, and 1000XM2, with reviews being a bit equivocal on the XM3. I was expecting the XM4 to blow the H900N away, but really they are barely better except for multipoint and ANC.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2020",AGNOHQRHY74UUQ6YUYPHD5MWD6JA,True,17,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only,
R6SURW0X715LZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Noise Canceling is Amazing,KL03,5,"This was my first time using noise canceling headphones and I was amazed by how good the noise canceling was. I put them on while on an airplane and the tight fitting cups sealed around my ears, slightly reducing the noise of the plane. Then I turned on the noise canceling and everything went silent. I had no idea that noise canceling could work this well.I bought the XM4 over the newer XM5 because some reviews said they were better. Overall I'm very happy with them and I will be bringing them with me every time I travel on a plane.Pros:-Excellent noise canceling-Very good battery life. They last much longer than an ipad or phone when watching movies.-Can still be used as regular wired headphones if the battery dies, or if bluetooth isn't an option, like with an airplane screen. I should note that the noise canceling will still work when wired if the battery is good.-Nice small case for travelingCons:-They are kind of small for over the ear style headphones, so you probably won't like them if you have large ears.-Most of the controls aren't actual buttons, so it's hard to figure them out. I feel like I need to pull out the manual every time I want to use them.","Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2024",AH2TMNDROGMPVZDOWNBG6KOANSPA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,

R1NL6NRC83D8N1,4.0 out of 5 stars Audiophile Perspective,A. Matthewson,4,"I got the MX4's for use when driving and in a noisy office location while doing college work. I also listen to music and audiobooks/podcasts nearly all day, and it is not uncommon for me to have a pair of cans on for 8-12 hours daily. Moving forward, my main comparison is with the Senheiser HD599 ($200) and the HiFiman HE4XX's ($150, plus $200 for a Schitt Modi/Magni DAC and AMP setup, coming to a total of $350 for all three pieces of hardware). My use case is pretty high-volume listening therefore, and my musical tastes go from Jazz, Pop and Trap to Classical, Folk, Acoustic, and Rock. Overall, I would definitely recommend the MX4's IF you are needing the top-end noise cancelation, as the hype surrounding the NC performance is definitely more reality than fiction. It makes my commutes and listening experience in noisy environments, including an interstate, very enjoyable and less fatiguing. I also certainly enjoy the convenience and mobility of these headphones, and the battery life has been excellent thus far. However, if you do not need the absolute best noise cancelling, or maybe don't care so much about mobility, then I would not recommend them due chiefly for the price and audio quality compromise. I shall elaborate, first with what I like:- Comfort (though for bigger ears it may be a little less so).- Build quality is good for a headphone in this price bracket, given the tech.- Noise cancelling is honestly unbelievable, though please note these are my very first pair of NC headphones.- Decent sound for what it is, with good battery life to boot.- Cool intelligent tech, though admittedly I do not use it at all (I keep NC on at all times and do not utilize the speech recognition feature).- Mobility.- Truly some great tech thrown in here, and I can see the R&D going to work, also fairly useful app.Cons:- Price.- Sound quality is lacking when compared to setups at this price point (though I hear it is the best sound quality when comparing to other NC cans), however more on this below.- Ears can become warm after a while.- This may be just me, but I have issues with ear pressure changes throughout the day and can cause a feeling of needing to - and not being able to - ""pop"" my ears, which is annoying and causes long-term comfort to be an issue for long sessions, forcing me to switch back to my faithful 599's.To elaborate, I have HiFiman x Drop HE4XX'S, with a Schitt Modi/Magni stack DAC/AMP. This entire package cost me the same exact price as the MX4's from Sony, and the sound quality is essentially night and day difference. Sound stage, separation, and dynamic sound range is definitely noticeably worse on the MX4's, and there is significant bleed through the bass and mids in some songs. For reference I am listening on Tidal, with Master track quality. Even on my HE4XX's, the bass is tighter and more responsive, and, while not a bass-havy pair of cans, provides a much more accurate and tight listening experience across all ranges. This is partially due to the open back versus closed back design, but again for the price, if you do not care about being so mobile, or perhaps work from home or are a student doing much of your work and homework from a home office or fixed location like myself, I would suggest looking elsewhere. If you travel all the time and absolutely cannot live without maximum portability and noise cancelling, then the MX4's are the way to go. The sound quality is adequate (though I still grit my teeth when considering how much these cost compared to my true audiophile headphone set ups given the sound quality), especially when compared to other closed-back designs, and again the NC is absolutely insane. Another point is that firmware updates will hopefully keep improving on the already impressive and interesting tech inside these cans.All in all, I really do like the MX4's, but due to the price, it makes me hard to recommend to someone who cares chiefly about sound quality first, and the convenience and portability/NC factors second. If this is the case, I'd say go to something with a better sound profile, and you will likely find yourself spending less with a better musical experience, and a recommendation off the top of my head would be the EXCELLENT Senheiser HD599's (around $200 new on Amazon). Personally, if they would have saved on some R&D and kept the voice and calling features to a minimum but dropped the price, this would be a no-brainer for everyone, but I digress. If however, you need the solid NC and are excited about the mobility and convenience and the versatility that these cans can bring, and are okay with the compromise on sound quality as well as the steep asking price, I would say you would be hard-pressed to go anywhere else than the MX4's. I am still debating on keeping these or not, as I have been spoiled with amazing sound experiences for the past 3-5 years now, and I find it hard to take a hit to my pocketbook like this when I could get a truly awe-inspiring pair of audiophile cans to use with my current setup for the same exact price, though the MX4's are good enough to make it a hard decision which is itself a promising sign.Tldr; Should you buy the MX4's? It depends, but I do like them, and you need to just consider your use case when making that decision. This is a lot of money to spend on a pair of headphones, and if sound quality plays a large part in your decision, you have some serious competition to look at. Would I say I recommend the MX4's in general? Yes.","Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2020",AEHBO45A5VT7QL4WOIMAXEQOW26Q,True,21,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only,
R32NKDVGVF2QPR,5.0 out of 5 stars Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great!,JWH,5,"The Sony WH-1000XM4 Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great! Put on the headphones, turn on the power and it's like the aircraft engines have turned off - the low rumble is just gone. Entertainment doesn't have to be turned as loud in order to hear it clearly.The best thing about the Sony is that it can be used ""wired"" into airline entertainment, rather than having always to rely on finicky BlueTooth. The Sony comes with a two-prong adapter to fit the airlines two-prong plug holes, but the adapter isn't necessary (at least on United Airliness 787 aircraft). It appeared to me the two-prong aircraft sockets were made up of 3.5mm and a 2.5mm holes. (I didn't have a 2.5mm plug, so I can't swear to that.) The Sony jack was 3.5mm and it worked well plugging it into the other, 3.5mm, socket - complete stereo worked. From testing at home I'd say the wired configuration provides slightly better sound than through BlueTooth, also. Wired appears to provide better power usage, too; I used it on a 17-hour flight for three movies, I think, and arrived with the power level at 80% from starting at 90%.It does require a bit of a learning curve, so I wouldn't expect a newbie like me to pull it out of the box for the first time while on the aircraft and expect it to be satisfying. This is my first ANC device in maybe 10 years and that first experience wasn't successful, so it took me awhile to try again. Basically, hold the power button for two seconds to turn it on, hold it for seven seconds to pair with BlueTooth. You can get by without the Sony headphones app, but without it you won't know the battery charge level or be able to change sound profiles; I want to hear dialog better, so I have bass present, but not overwhelmingly so. Interestingly, you can pair the headphones with two devices at the same time, while other ANC earbuds just switch fast between two different connections. Both appear to work okay and allow you to listen to your cellphone music or the aircraft entertainment. Sony has short little movies that walked me through headphone settings.That's a lot of ""pro,"" but there are a few ""cons."" Over-ear headsets are bulky and have to be carried in already stuffed carry-on luggage. Some people don't like the pressure of over-ear headsets on their ears. That's about it, though, and if you've bought them at all then these issues don't sneak up on you. I've had them for a month or so now so I can't speak to their sturdiness or long-term reliability, but they do appear to be sturdy and the case protects them.What would I like to see improved? Not much, for over-ear ANC headsets. If I could find a set of wired ANC earbuds I'd surely try them to cut down on the bulk, but they'd have to work very well to provide the same sense of isolation I get from over-ear headsets. As things are, this Sony is definitely a ""buy.""","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AEGS73DFBTN563YPSMA2EM2EEEAA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,

Not easy to increase the volume using the headphone by sweeping up on the right earmuff, just use the TV volume buttons.

R3LOW0OAVZVPNN,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise canceling, everything else is ok",MyHonest2Cents,4,"In passive mode, the sound quality is all over the place, resulting in some of the worst headphones I've ever used in this price bracket. In active mode, it's... decent, with boomy, mildly unclean bass; acceptable mids; and messy but listenable highs. It is very responsive to EQ past sub-bass range, though you can crank up the already boomy mid-bass if that's your thing and it can get pretty loud. At about 70–80% volume, the amp begins to distort, and at 100% volume the distortion is highly audible and really crunches the highs and muddies the bass. There is also a noticeable frequency response and volume difference between the cups, likely due to the indentation for the sensor array inside the left cup; if you aren't listening for it, it is still noticeable sometimes, but it fades to the background if you are using the noise canceling or are otherwise occupied.The ambient sound feature does not pick up outside sounds very clearly. If you're using the Sony | Headphones Connect app, you can enable a ""voice mode"" for ambient sound that cuts out the bass and boosts vocal range with EQ, but it cannot be turned on with the toggle buttons on the headphones themselves or when connected to PC, making it tedious to enable without the automatic switching feature that tracks your location and habits to enable it when it thinks you need it. The noise canceling however is truly top of its class and easily removes 80–90% of outside noise, and you can't hear anything else if you're playing something. I have noticed that the DSP appears to crank up the bass, either to compensate for the harder-to-remove low-end frequencies or to trick you into thinking the noise canceling is better than it really is in that range.The ear cup touch controls work fine and I have not had any mis-inputs, though volume up/down steps are too small. You can hold down the up/down slider instead of repeatedly sliding your finger, but the repeat delay is very long and it takes forever to adjust to what you want.The headphones are fairly adjustable to different head shapes, but if you have a reeeally big head/ears or lots of hair it may be difficult. The headband padding is a bit hard but the headphones are so light you can't feel it. The closed cups have no ventilation so your ears stay warm, and I imagine it would get sweaty in warmer weather.The headphones can fold flat and can sit around your neck comfortably. The auto-pause when it detects you remove them, and the 15 minute auto-off means you don't ever need to bother turning them off explicitly, just take them off your head and put them down. Their ability to fold also works great for stowing them, and you can fit them into any bag. The included carry case is a bit bulkier than it probably needs to be, but it's still small enough to fit in even a medium sized purse, and it does have room for cables and small accessories.The mic quality is pretty bad and doesn't pick up your voice well. What it does pick up well is everything around you. You'd think Sony's engineers could have used the ambient sound mics to dampen outside noise while focusing on your voice, but it unfortunately doesn't do that. Call sound quality in general takes a major dive due to the protocol it uses under the hood; it halves the sample rate and sounds like a cheap dollar store headset.The battery is massive; I charged it to 90% once I received it a few days ago and have not had to charge it since with daily listening. Rtings.com got 37 hours out of one charge, far past the advertised duration.Overall all of the features work to an acceptable level, except passive mode sound quality. If you are buying these for the battery longevity, small stowable size, ease of use, and noise isolation and canceling, they're a great package. Great for traveling. Would not recommend for even casual listening, get a good closed back pair like the Hifiman HE-R9 + Bluemini R2R wireless dongle. If you need to make important calls or want headphones for conference calls or online meetings, these will work, but it won't be pleasant—get a dedicated conference headset.If you really insist on these for more active listening situations, do yourself a favor and get the AutoEQ preset for them as a baseline, and tweak to your ears. I also recommend a -1dB loss on the left earcup to help offset the response difference, though it's an approximation and not perfect and differences in track volume will make this obvious. With these changes, passive mode is at least bearable.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2022",AGXVB4UEYOJCFXO6XR45I52IWWWQ,True,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R1JKUN1J8FVF5H,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beast Headphones, solid Noise-cancelling/ beautiful sound/ Comfort.. But don't pay full price.",xnpate,4,"Last several months I've spent studying for MCAT, and as it neared the exam I needed more time away from distractions and due to the pandemic sneaking away to my local libraries wasn't an option as I could only be there for an hour or two tops, I needed NC headphones being at home. Typically anytime I saw anything NC the WH1000 series was the way to go, as advised by the tech world and audiophiles. I had found a good deal on Airpods Pro and during Prime Day Deals found these. I was shocked to find the latest Sony headphones discounted $50 and bundled with $25 Amazon GC as well. The reason I mention Airpods is because I personally have seen many comparisons. I'll break down as much as I can below, I don't consider myself an audiophile.Pros:When it comes to sound and listening to music with the Sonys hands-down best thing I've listened to and gives like new life to music. These are built really nicely and cushioned really well up top and around the ears. Oh man boy are they lightweight!. Some heat around my ears after using them for a bit, and they press on my glasses (but they're crappy glasses that I have problems with beforehand anyway) so they press in my ears/head.Battery: Lasts me several uses on one charge, meaning I can use them a good 4-5 days before wanting to charge them. Sometimes I can get a couple hours in and still not even lose 10% of battery life. (when compared to Airpods, no question Sonys better). When not used for a period of time they will automatically shut off so even better.Case: Nice holds your cords and headphones nicely. It's not a hard case though so I'd be careful shoving them into tight spaces against things.While i mentioned the cables... Sony needs to make the charging cable longer it's INCREDIBLY short.Cons:Touch controls: The lack of buttons to control Play/Pause, Volume, kind of sucks for me. At first it seems fun and intriguing. But over the course of using them, I find myself swiping and hearing the feedback that something is being activated but actually wont happen. There are moments when I'm stretching or resting my behind my head and arm knicks the touch control and pauses the music. And this is weird because the touchpad can be really sensitive like in that example, but other times wont register I'm trying to activate the controls. Volume should absolutely just be a wheel, pause/play skip features as touch I'd be okay with.Dual connection: I haven't had much use of this, at first I had my laptop and iPhone connected. Now Idk if my problem is due to my older computer with older Bluetooth, but my sound went silent on my headphones. I haven't connected them back to my laptop since. But I think ideally this would be great to be connected to your phone/computer and get notifications. There is a delay between activating playback from one device to the next.Mic: Friends have told me my voice sounds artificial with Sonys and prefer if I wear my Airpods to communicate if I want to use headphones.Noise-CancellingTo anyone who wants a comparison between Airpods Pro and these. If I hadn't had Airpods Pro right before purchasing these I'd have nothing poor to say about the Sony's NC. Airpods as they go in the ear already help with dulling sound before activating NC. The biggest issue I have in my house is the droning of my AC and Fans. Airpods make them disappear and sound like a light breeze or wind without all the mechanical droning from noise machinery. Sonys do a good job for those sounds for me, but not as well as the Airpods. HOWEVER, this is before any music or sound playing. Once you have something playing with the Sonys the world is gone and that's about half-ish volume. I find myself speaking louder at times not even being able to realize my brother is talking right next to me. I don't necessarily have the same effect with Airpods. And you don't have to worry about fit.ConnectivityI've heard that with Android getting the XM4 connected is quick, but even with iPhone it's simply connecting another Bluetooth device. (compared to airpods obviously the apple interface is as simple as opening your headphone case)AppPretty easy to follow interface, readily updates. If you like experimenting with equalizer settings then you'll have fun. I've heard people complain it being complicated, but without messing with anything except turning off a setting that pauses audio when talking. You can leave everything as is and really not need it after the initial setup and for updates.Final thoughts if you have the money I'd go for these they're wonderful, but I don't think these warrant the full price TBH. The touch controls can be finicky, but if you want quality sound/NC/Comfort/Fit this is it. Anyone seeing this right during the holidays with BlackFriday/Christmas/Cyberdeals whatever; I was shocked seeing these brand new Sonys discounted to the same price as the XM3 on Amazon, I'd look for these and nab them when discounted.","Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2020",AFY3JHUWWTAHBJZNBVXSOOORVGMQ,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R2D8OVJ75Z7DSP,5.0 out of 5 stars 1000 hr review,C Stribs,5,"Alright, So I have put alot of time into these 1000xm4s over the last three months. These headphones are fantastic! However it took me about 50-100 hours to get used to them. I'll explain. So I have owned cheap ""noise canceling"" TAO Tonic $40 black friday special wireless headphones and I had good wired $200 Sennheiser 599 open ear headphones. My previous experiences with headphones were to get the most out of the audio or to cancel out noise I needed to near max out sound volume and reach deafening thresholds. After listening to these headphones I started to realize I needed to change the way I was using these headphones. First of all the app is nice. You can adjust the EQ to custom or use a preset EQ setting. I chose to turn of the speak-to-chat as it would easily pick up my voice if I was singing along or making any loud adublie sound while working out. But getting back on track I found that I could listen to music, podcasts, Netflix ect at a very low level and hear everything perfectly. I was so use to staying at a 80-90 percent volume from my previous headphones that I was at little sad that the 80-90 level on this headset didn't sound as loud as my older headphones. Simply put these bad boys do such a great job noise canceling that you can clearly hear audio at very low levels. You may not feel alot of punchy bass with them (it's there though) you also won't hear any distortion even bumped to max levels. Also, these Sonys will automatically and continuously track your environment and adjust noise canceling and ambient sounds according to if your laying in bed or get up to a walk, or sitting a plane ect. They will also save you hearing as well but sadly not your bank account. If you plan to work out with them they will be a solid option. Again I haven't heard any distortion while working out or on a treadmill, bike, or rowing machine. Since they are closed ear style they may get warm on your head. I always get a q-tip out and swipe off the sweat condensation that accumulates inside the left ear cup on the plastic ear sensor after workouts (I dont know if this is recommended). I haven't had any issues with them slipping off my head either. The hand and swipe gestures take a little time to get used to but work well. Every now and then the swipe forward/backward and up/down to skip tracks or volume doesnt work but I feel this is user error on my part. The cover over the right headphone is a cool feature. It will easily flood ambient sound in allowing you to quickly and temporarily converse with someone or you could leave the speak to chat feature on. Additionally you receive a nice hard carrying case, charger brick, usb-C cable, and aux cord. I've used the aux cord quite a bit with my nintendo switch and it does a great job. Also the 1000xm4s are very forgiving if you forget to plug them in when runinng low on power. In 10mins I can quick charge them to last about10hours. I think the specs say 3 hours till 100% charge but I swear I had my headphones fully charged in about 1 hour. They are dual voltage which has been great for traveling abord. Lastly you can connect up to two Bluetooth devices which at time. Honestly I didn't think I would even need this feature. However I found out it is very convenient for seemlesly swapping devices or getting notifications from my phone/watch while connected to my laptop or when I'm bluetooth connected to my switch. So they are a great pair of headphones but you will take a hit to bank account. I picked up a open box Amazon return which knocked off over $100 on the price and the headphones came without any issues. If you see these on a decent sale I would scoop up a pair. Also if you want more of a punchy bass type headphones I would also recommend XBN-900N which I tested out shortly and you can tell they are more focused on bass bumping. I believe they are significantly cheaper new but don't have all of the same features.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2022",AH4Y52RTEYUMLCRPZVE3UJLJBNRQ,True,26,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R11GP1556DW75I,"5.0 out of 5 stars Beyond anything I could have imagined...if noise distracts, buy back your productivity!",Mike,5,"I have used active noise canceling technology in protective ear muffs, and I have had some ear buds that were passive noise canceling, so I kind of thought I had an idea what these where going to be like. Nothing could prepare me for my first impression, and we’ll every subsequent impression.My wife does telemedicine from home, and soon we plan to add another dedicated office, but for right now we share a room. The distraction of having a constant conversation in the background has driven me to feel like a nomad - wandering from flat spot to flat spot. The laptop isn’t an issue, but the scanner, 32” monitor, keyboard, keypad, paperwork,etc...well you get the point. So I found a 17” led up in the attic...no go, for the record don’t ever get used to one size monitor than essentially try to get use to one 1/4th that size. I tried listening to music with my passive ear buds, finally I used my protective muffs that I have for mowing, shooting, anything loud and it sort of worked but those try to defeat harmful noise levels. I tried wearing earbuds playing music underneath the muffs and while that worked, my ears however felt like they had been in a vice.Well that leads me to these, while these are more costly than anything I ever have purchased for audio - other than my home theater equipment. Let me say now I’m case I am being wordy, these are worth every penny.I can be attached to both my iPhone and laptop, so I can get feedback from my computer or listen to audio and still here when I get an alert on my phone. When I wish, the head phones do not require any actual music or anything. I literally feel like I am alone in a “cone of silence” for those familiar with the old Get Smart episodes. If my wife or any other family member needs me it is easier to text me than to call out to me. While that is a little inconvenient, my ability to concentrate has increased multi-fold which has also allowed my productivity to feeling a pure joy rather than the stress of always feeling like you need to do more.These are also light, and have no issue navigating by size 8 head. The app setup for these is wild. I have done moldable ear plugs, but I never dreamed I would take a selfie and then snap shots of each ear to customize the sound. The other fascinating thing happened completely by accident, I was listening to a presentation online but needed to work on dinner. I thought I paused the pc and joined on the phone. But evidently I never stopped the pc and hearing audio I didn’t worry about anything. Well I realized that my pc was communicating with the Sony app and the app was evidently acting like a radio repeater...I was out of range of my office but set my phone out of the way where it won’t get wet, dropped or anything else. It was only when I tried to stop the presentation did I realize what had occurred. I now use this all the time and have subsequently learned to pause/play with the controls. Lastly, and this will completely give away the secret that I never read instructions...I could not figure out how to connect a phone call. I used the buttons like I do on my other Bluetooth earbuds, but that didn’t work. I felt stupid when I learned all that I had to do was tap the center of the right muff.I know this is a lot of money, and While it is rare for productivity be literally monetized unless you are on commission, I can tell you that these allow for peace in total chaos...oh, if I had these 20 years ago when our second child was colicky🙂.I normally buy black by default, grey if black isn’t available, but my wife encouraged me to try the blue. While I am color blind, I still see color, amd like the blue...my wife also likes the color which is way more important. I am starting to sense that I will be buying another pair of these for my wife because when she is charting on her EMR distractions are awful.","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2021",AGR7CTQV4ETCIWAPZDP42W5V6EQA,True,3,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only,
R3JI08GCH5LUUQ,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, but several issues make it a no-go for me. Sticking with my Bose QC 35 Series I",Dennis,2,"I have owned the Bose QC 35 series I (the originals) for four years now, and just recently replaced the ear pads since they finally deteriorated. I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them.I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome.The sound is very impressive. Punchy kick drum (I listen mostly to rock/metal) and nice bright sound. I quickly settled on a slightly customized version of the included Bright preset.But things quickly went downhill from there.After using the headphones for a bit, the touch controls became frankly annoying and easily susceptible to mistakes (I triggered track skips multiple times just by removing and putting the headphones back on). The volume adjustment is especially tedious...if you want to raise or lower the volume significantly you have to swipe it up or down a large number of times because the volume adjustment is done in small increments. With the Bose QC 35 and its dedicated buttons, you just quickly push the buttons. Simple.I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to pair the headphones with my laptop, reading the guide in the app and doing some web searching, thinking it must be provided by one of the two dedicated buttons like on the Bose QE 35s. Nope. It must be done with the app. In fact, everything has to be done with the app except whatever you have the custom button configured to do, and the power. On the Bose I just have to slide the power button, and it goes into pairing mode. Simple.The above are honestly smaller issues that you could probably put up with since the sound these produce is so good. However, the deal breaker for me was when I connected them with the included wire to the controller on my Roku Ultra to enjoy some TV time after a long day. I always watch movies and TV with headphones. To my horror they produced a clearly audible hissing sound that is incredibly distracting. I turned them off and on again, disconnected and reconnected the cable. No change, still the hissing sound. My Bose don't produce this sound. Ugh.After listening to them for a couple hours I had a slight headache and felt fatigued, almost nauseous. I know some people are affected differently by the noise cancelling technology, but I don't get this from my Bose, even after listening to them all day.Additionally, speaking of noise cancelling, I compared my Bose QC 35s to these, and I couldn't tell the difference between the noise cancelling. They sound the same to me. :shrug: I'm sure you could tell the difference with laboratory equipment though.All-in-all the sound these produce is really good, and the noise cancelling is great (although I can't tell the difference from my Bose QC 35 Series I). But they have 1) lots of annoyances in the touch controls instead of dedicated buttons, 2) the fact that the app is required to do everything (including pairing) except turning them off and activating the custom button, 3) the hissing on the wired connection to my Roku Ultra, and 4) the fatiguing after listening to them.I'll be returning them.","Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2020",AFERWW2A4UHMJIFE23HMMIJL2SXA,True,1914,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R1JJLGFUZ7LMKT,4.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones I've ever owned but -1 star for several minor usability issues,Tayne,4,"As of about three years ago, I was an earbuds guy. The wireless over-hear headphones I had tried previously never could approximate the kind of audio immersion you get when you wedge little speakers directly into your ear canals. I never found over-hear headphone noise cancellation to work that well - often, turning it on would create more noise than it cancelled, compromising audio quality and, well, just sucking generally. Not to mention the inconsistent and typically non-intuitive affordances for powering on/off, pairing, and controlling playback on these things.But then I picked up a pair of Sony's WH-H900N noise cancelling wireless headphones. I basically fell in love with them on day one and used the heck out of them over the past 3 years. So, now I'm an over-ear headphones guy. Specifically, THIS line of over-ear headphones that Sony is putting out.I still love my H900Ns. But we all know that in tech a lot can change in 3 years time. In fact, I was about to upgrade to the WH-1000XM3s a few months ago but held off after learning about the imminent release of the M4s. So I waited. Then I pre-ordered. Yesterday, I received them.I've now had about 24 hours to toy around with them and I'm already prepared to say that these are clearly the best headphones I've ever owned. Which is to say: They're everything I love about my WH-900Ns, but better:- They're noticeably lighter, and based on about 5 hours of use I'm convinced they're more comfortable to wear- Sound quality is significantly better. I didn't actually expect this amount of improvement, but it's definitely noticeable at both low and high end. Separation of layers is particularly amazing: vocals shine with total clarity, heavy bass tracks shake and vibrate my skull without any noticeable distortion; high-hats and snares are crisp and clear. Very happy with this so far, which i should mention is just using the default settings with songs downloaded from Spotify. I'm looking forward to optimizing further with custom equalizer settings in the sound connect app.- Small thing but the semi-hardshell case with dedicated accessory storage (pictured) is really nice to have (900Ns just came with a bag...)- Clarity of phone calls - both input and output (i.e., the mic works well) - is excellent. This is key as I plan to use these to listen to music and take meetings while WFH for the foreseeable future. The 900Ns were also very good in this regard, but the ability to connect to both my work computer and my mobile device simultaneously will really help me out during the work week.CONNECTING TO TWO DEVICES SIMULTANEOUSLYOne of the issues is figuring out how to connect to these things to two devices at the same time. Given that this is a new and much-anticipated feature, I would have thought Sony would have thought to make it crystal clear to new users how to actually do this. Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't find instructions for how to do this. Here are the steps I discovered through trial and error that allowed me to simultaneously connect to both my iPhone and Mac Mini:1. You may have to enable the feature from within the Headphones mobile app. For me, it was disabled. See photo I uploaded showing the relevant part of the application.2. You need to first pair the headphones to each device separately before it is possible to connect to them simultaneously. As far as I can tell, there is no way to put the headphones in pairing mode when they're connected to a device.3. Then, when the headphones are connected to one of the devices, you should be able to connect your second device to the headphones using the second device's bluetooth preferences.4. If the second device successfully connects, you'll hear a voice notification through the headphones: ""Bluetooth device 2 connected"". You'll also see two devices listed under the ""Status"" tab of the Headphones Connect application.Not a big deal, but seems silly that something like the above wasn't just in Sony's own documentation.OTHER MINOR GRIEVANCES AND NITPICKSIt seems that the only way to get the most out of these is to use them with your Android or iOS device. This is because a lot of functionality - such as the ability to customize sound - is only available on iOS/Android devices with the Sony Headphones Connect application. The iOS app is decidedly intended for use on iPhones - it only runs in portrait orientation, making it a pain to use on my iPad (which I almost always use in landscape orientation). But the worst thing about this is that I can't customize anything when listening on a MacOS device, which these days is a lot of the time. Fortunately, these sound excellent even with the default settings - just wish the capabilities of these headphones wasn't dependent on which device I was using them with.Final minor grievance (for now) is this adaptive sound control feature that Sony got me to try out. It requires location sharing and by default fires annoying and surprisingly frequent notifications on my iPhone about how it's apparently adapting to my ambient environment. I figured out how to mute the notifications but still need to figure out how to shut the feature off entirely, which I frankly have had enough of. My advice is to opt out of this feature when you first set your headphones up. Very disruptive with totally unclear benefits.FINAL WORD (FOR NOW)Again, best headphones I've ever owned, and I'm very happy with my purchase. But the minor issues I describe above, combined with the high cost of these things, were enough to knock a star off my rating. Buyer beware :)","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2020",AGEKBKA2Z63J7U3URXIPCFNZQOGQ,True,379,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,

The noise canceling is very nice too, and you can put your hand over the side of it which is great to hear random conversations without taking them off, albeit you look pretty dumb.

R24CNHZWHJRWOV,"3.0 out of 5 stars GREAT for Music -- BAD for Calls, Teams, etc",David Diskin,3,"Because I do so many meetings over Teams (I'm a professional software trainer), I thought it would be time to finally invest in a really good headset. Up until now, I'd been using a $50 over-ear set by MPOW with a really nice boom mic. It was great, but it wasn't wireless, certainly wasn't portable, and didn't have the audio quality I'd want when listening to music.I thought that by splurging more than $300 on a Sony product I'd get something that was beyond all of my expectations. I was almost right, but so very wrong in other ways.CASE: Let's start here. The case is as slim as can be, very high-quality build, looks nice, feels nice, keeps everything protected. Excellent design here with one flaw: you can't really charge the headphones while they're snug in the case; they don't fold up the right way.APP: To use most of the features, Sony requires you to download an app to your smartphone. That wasn't a big deal and the app was easy to figure out. It crashed twice on me (once during the first setup, again the next day). It offered some location-based services but I declined and it never asked me again. It wanted me to sign up for a free trial of some 360° music service -- not sure what that is, but I skipped it. I was disappointed that there wasn't a PC version of the app. For example, if I needed to switch which device the headphones were connected to, I can only do that from my phone -- that means my phone always has to be one of the two devices. There's no way to control the advanced features, or the equalizer, from the PC.PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing was hit or miss, over and over again. If I were only pairing to my phone, I think it would be fine. But I wanted to also pair it to my desktop and laptop. The device supports pairing to two devices at the same time -- which was great -- but nearly every time I wanted to switch devices I had to literally turn off bluetooth so the headset would ""let go"". Other times, upon reconnecting, the mic wouldn't work. Once, which turned out to be the final straw for me, was when I could not get the headset to work in Teams no matter what I tried, even though it worked fine a few hours earlier. (For context: I literally train employees and other trainers on how to use Teams, so I very much know what I'm doing.)SOUND QUALITY: Let me say that the sound quality IS exceptional. I had a blast listening to all my favorite songs streaming from my phone or laptop. I really can't understate the quality, base and treble. And the ANC (active noise cancelling) was AMAZING. I could be sitting right next to a whole house fan and not hear it. I was blown away.RANGE: Twice during the day I tried walking around while on a call. It wasn't until I went downstairs that anyone said the quality of my voice had dropped. If I was less than 25 feet from the device, everything was great.BATTERY LIFE: After a day of use it was down to about 50% and that impressed me. Then I watched TV and ate dinner and later that evening I put on the headphones and realized that the battery dropped to 10%. I thought the system had an auto-off feature but something didn't quite work.CHARGING: So after my surprise drop in battery, I plugged it into my desktop with a USB C cable I already had. A little light on the headset turned red. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the headphones were still at 10%. Apparently the USB C cable I use to charge my mouse won't charge the headphones. I guess you need to use the cable it ships with? I'm not sure what the deal was here, but that was pretty annoying.CONTROLS: I found the touch/gesture controls to be mostly intuitive. Pro Tip: If you swipe up and hold your finger, the volume slowly increments up. Once, however, I accidentally hung up a Teams call when I was trying to adjust the volume. I love the feature that let's me hear ambient sound by cupping my hear -- super cool. Tap the power button to hear the battery level -- very nice touch! However, there's one extremely important flaw in the controls that I was shocked to discover. THERE IS NO MUTE BUTTON. The ONLY way to mute your mic during a call (Teams, phone, Zoom, etc) is to use the mute button on the desktop/phone. The headset, whose very first bullet is ""clear hands-free calling"", has five built-in microphones, and a dedicated gesture to use Alexa... doesn't have a damn mute button. Sadly, the successor to this (the 1000XM5) has the same flaw.Individually, the issues I raised wouldn't be enough for me to return the headset or give it a low rating. But for a $350 purchase, I expect it to be able to do what it says correctly. I expect a mute button. I expect it to power off when not in use. I expect any generic USB cable to work. I expect to be able to join a meeting without fussing with bluetooth.I'd totally keep this if all I wanted it for was to listen to music.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2022",AFYFHYV5S7I7LYF7JRA63MPQGDTA,True,29,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R2JMIRC62ED8BT,4.0 out of 5 stars Saying Goodbye to Bose...,Kaladin Stormblessed,4,"I've been pro-Bose for YEARS (QC35's being the most recent headphones). Not necessarily for the booming bass/audio quality, but for the convenience factor (on the go, on the plane, zoom meetings, etc...), excellent battery life + amazing noise cancellation. To balance, I have a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 (though oddly designed), sound great both via Bluetooth or cabled/analog via a DragonFly, playing FLAC, etc...Well..., my QC35's encountered the infamous always-on ""feature."" Flipping the button to off will give you an audible beep that it's being powered off, only to find that you missed 20 calls in your log that you never heard ring. If you're under warranty, you're golden (they'll offer to fix or a discounted upgrade). If not, you're forced to operate with miniature tools under a magnifying glass to bend the button contact points to maintain constant connectivity to the board. My QC35's were months out of warranty & I was SOL... Hacked per all the DIY vids which worked well for about 6 months. Earlier this week, however, I noticed several missed calls + the Bluetooth connection active. Sure enough, the Bose were ""back at it again..."" Didn't feel like hacking for another 6 month band-aid, so seriously considered picking up a pair of 700's. My coworkers, however, (the same ones who all originally had/suggested Bose), said they switched to Sony months ago... After researching pros & cons/side-by-side comparisons, the WH-1000XM4's seemed more & more a worthy competitor/option...Go-To Amazon of course had the WH-1000XM4's in-stock (& $60 cheaper than the Bose!), so ordered without hesitation. Headphones arrived (packaging & product) looking very slick (nice touch w/ the rose gold accents on black. Charged for about 30 minutes, then tested audio & call quality... BLOWN AWAY... Streaming music, movies, etc... seemed lightyears beyond what I subjected myself to w/ the Bose. My QC35's sounded flat & bass was non-existent. These headphones feel like I'm back in the mid 90's, cruising in my lowered Accord on wire wheels, bumping my Cerwin Vegas powered from an M100 Phoenix Gold Amp w/ Boston Acoustic pro series highs/mids. Yes, ""slight"" exaggeration (anyone w/ 12"" Vega's know what I'm talking about), but it DID take me back... Beyond impressed... No issues w/ audio quality as well on my Zoom's or direct bt to my phone.So..., audio quality is OUTSTANDING... What caught me off guard, however, was the noise cancellation! I thought Bose was amazing, but Sony's latest technology is on another level. It works so well, it's scary... Damn near can't hear a thing when they're on. Without any audio at all, it's as if you're trapped in ""soundproof vacuum purgatory,"" with nothing but you & your now blaringly loud tinnitus to keep you company. When you take them off after a few hours of wearing, you (to be continued: Apparently, my family has been calling my name for the last 10 minutes. They gave up & sent my youngest upstairs to physically wave her hands in front of me @ my workstation to tell me we're eating soon. Yes, the noise cancellation is THAT good). Ok, continuing where I left off above: When you take them off after a few hours of wearing, your ears are now hyper-sensitive to every day sounds. Birds chirping, humming of video equipment, the heater, etc... I always assumed that Bose was the leader in this technology, but Sony just knocked it out of the park...As far as cons? Very minimal & more of annoyances if anything... I use mine strictly for voice & audio (though I did install the app), so not really taking advantage of any of the advanced features. The Bose has a massive R & L inside the padding + the on/off switch is an easy queue as to which side is R or L. The Bose padding at the top of your head also appears to be a bit firmer/more comfortable. With the Sony, the buttons are camouflaged into speakers & the R & L are tiny (but color coded) markers on the inner headset. Marking is tiny, but as long as you associated Red with Right, then you're golden. Also, after a prolonged period of time, the very top of my head was throbbing/sore. I'd have to raise the headset slightly to give the to of my skull a break. Again, these are merely minor annoyances & the pros far outweigh the cons...Can't really say much more & for those TLDR, Sony's WH-1000XM4 put my Bose QC35's to shame (voice, audio & outstanding noise cancellation). Not sure how long these suckers will last, but assuming they stand the test of time, I don't see any reason why I'd ever return to Bose...","Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2020",AEYBZLL2AJCLTZWVTP6LC5TMDDBA,True,21,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R3D37IETBXFZQP,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Bluetooth Headphones I've had so far...,Daniel Meadows,5,"I have purchased and used a variety of wireless, over-ear style headphones over the years, but the Sony WH-1000XM4 (XM4's from here on), have provided a great experience so far! For simplicity's sake, I will only directly mention the other Sony pair I currently own, the XB900N.Note:This review is after one full (out of the box) charge. They lasted almost exactly three days after fairly heavy use. Material used during this period varied from heavy rock to classical, audiobooks, and videos from YouTube. Sections in the review are in CAPS for organization, not emphasis.The Positive:+ SOUND is phenomenal on these. Out of the box, they were almost on par with other sets I had set equalizer preferences for. Once the equalizer profiles were created for the XM4's, the music started sounding better than it ever has before through Bluetooth. These clearly favor a warm sound, and shine best when paired with bass heavy tracks, but all of my library has gotten some noticeable benefit from the XM4's.Sound is different for everyone, but these seem better out of the box than most I've tried, and custom profiles are easy to create with the Sony app.+ CONNECTIVITY was extremely easy. I had already installed the Sony companion app for headphones from the XB pair I had used before. I have not had any dropped connections so far.+ BUILD QUALITY feels like a pretty big step up from the XB900N's. Sturdy cans and a very soft headband are a nice combination. I've only had the XM4's for three days but I feel they will hold up fairly well. Considering I've had the XB pair for over a year with no noticeable degradation, I have high expectations here. The XM4's come with a great travel case too.The Neutral (still positive to me):1. CHARGING CORD is short. I like it because it is now the easiest charging cord to identify out of all the ones I currently use. The cord it is packaged with limits flexibility for charging locations, but is also perfectly functional for my needs.2. ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) function is good, almost too good. I have used these headphones a lot since I received them three days ago, and the first thing I noticed when I put them on- the ANC was overwhelming. I became somewhat queasy as soon as I turned them on. Once I opened the app I noticed there was a calibration tool for ANC. Once I went through that process, I no longer felt discomfort when using this feature. YMMV, but these block out most noise in my home, to the point it's just music or the book I'm listening to. I'm still getting used to how strong the ANC actually is.3. BATTERY LIFE was pretty good, but may have been somewhat under 100% out of the box, despite the headphones declaring a full charge when activated. I did not time my usage, but I probably got around 18 to 20 hours on the initial charge. Some settings for music quality and DSEE (sound enhancement for some content) will lower battery life according to Sony's companion app. It advised against using my settings for the best battery life experience. I appreciated but also ignored this advice. I know I won't be getting the full battery life from it, but it sounds so good! I'm leaving this detail under neutral to see if I get the same- or better - performance from a true 100% charge. Edit: lasted about the same, maybe one additional hour. Still good for daily, heavy use.4. TOUCH CONTROLS are a big debate among users of Bluetooth headphones. I happen to like how responsive these are, but I've also really liked some other headphones out there that had good old fashioned dials and buttons. I don't know which I prefer over the other, but the touch controls for the XM4's are not bad.The Negatives:- These get pretty warm. Ultimately, it isn't an issue to me because I wear glasses and they are still comfortable, just warm after longer sessions.Overall:The best Bluetooth headphones I've come across! Definitely worth the price on sale. The XM4's do not disappoint and provide truly top-tier ANC functionality. My new favorite headphones for music and audiobooks on the go.Thank you for reading my review!Hopefully the XM4's are finished recharging by now.Have a great day!","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2021",AFXQD236J4IAIPMMDUVPGYEZ6PNA,True,43,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,

Before buying the Sony WH1000XM4, I had never ventured over the $200.00 mark. As far as wireless goes, I was fairly happy with the two IEMs and one headphone set from Soundcore. Mainly because of their outstanding app that let you tailor sound. When I saw the WH1000XM4s at $240.00 I was curious. There was no way I could stretch my budget for the XM5s.It took a lot for me to stretch for the $240.00. I'm happy to report that I did not waste my money. The noise control is effective to the point that I don't have to blast the headphones in the presence of heavy traffic. Why don't other companies reduce the price of their Hyped product when they are replace by newer models so that us people who are on strict budget can get a taste of the ""good life"".These headphones sound so good right out of the box, that I have yet to experiment with the app equalizer to change anything.

R1QCC0WCTVPPPJ,4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable and Quiet,EliteTek IT,4,"Scroll to the bottom for pros and cons!The amazing sound produced by these Headphones can only be matched by the perfection of the ACN(Active Noise Canceling). With dynamic control from an app on your device to to the touch controls on the earpiece, ease of use is definitely a bonus feature. Sony spared no expense in attempting to build a lightweight comfortable headset and they succeeded.I purchased these headphones for a couple different reasons. First and foremost was for a long international flight I was preparing to take, and second was for a gym alternative to my AirPods. Though I have nothing against the AirPods, I was tired of sticking things in my sweaty ears.The first thing I noticed about these Sony headphones was the Dolby Atmos surround sound clarity. I first tested them in my home with my laptop making sure the Bluetooth connection was solid and clean. I was amazed at the dynamic range of sound and the realistic sound placement while watching high action scenes. I literally felt like I could look around and see the gunmen.The second thing I noticed was the amazing quality of the ACN which can be adjusted for sound pass through in the app. While walking through the airport, my phone lost signal for a moment and i immediately feared the headphones were the issue. As I removed them from my ears I was shocked at how loud the airport was. People talking, jets whirring up to taxi, the voice over the PA had been completely shut out. I put them back on my ears again and took them off several times marveling at the difference. Now that my childlike wonder was satisfied and it was time to board my plane.While waiting for taxi I listened to the cabin taking in all sounds and soon found myself dying to drown out the noise again. I set the pass through to about half sensitivity and put them back on. After some adjustment in the app I was able to find a perfect balance of cabin announcements and my music (Shinedown, Breaking Benjamin, Morgan Whalen for reference).Ultimately over the course of the next 24 hours these headphones never left my head. I only needed to place them on to the charger after landing at the destination. Yes I was awake the whole time attempting to counteract jet lag. Conversely on the return trip I used nothing but the ACN to drown out noise and I slept comfortably(as you can on a plane) with them on the whole way home. These headphones completely stopped the drone of the engines and made for an enjoyable listening experience.The only thing that has disappointed me regarding my Sony Headphones is their functionality during active gym sessions. Though they were not excessively hot, sweat tended to make the earpieces very slick. They would slide around and even off while lying in horizontal positions such as bench press or push ups. In both sessions I wore these I found myself paying way more attention to trying to find a way to stop the slipping that I eventually took them off midway through the second session due to annoyance.Overall for lightly active people(walkers, hikers, traveling by car plane train) these headphones are a great sound at a great value. My only reason for a 4 star rating is the inability to use them functionally in the gym. (Yes I know there is nothing that claims these are for active wear)Pros:-comfort-lightweight-great battery life-ACN works wonderfully-Amazing Bluetooth range-convenient folding design makes storage easyCons:- not meant for active individuals that sweat.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2023",AFDGGVDZE73UGIVTZLZNANPP7NDA,True,15,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,

My bedroom contains the entrance to the underworld so it's usually around 81F/27C even with the A/C cranked. Because of this I have a rather loud tower fan right next to my computer desk. When I first power on these headphones I actually checked the fan to make sure it was still running. The headphones cut out the sound completely!

R161CZ0PS65QJQ,5.0 out of 5 stars I love these headphones! The best!!!!!,Janel MH,5,"So let's get the cons out of the way: pricey, but worth it!If hooking up Bluetooth headphones through a Bluetooth transmitter (for me I use one for my tv that doesn’t have Bluetooth), have to not download headphone app and make sure your phone doesn’t hook up to it via phone Bluetooth and you need to “forget this device” on your phone.For me I am not going to use these with my iPhone, so I deleted the app and did as above so my phone wouldn’t detect it, otherwise it’s hard to get it to connect to the transmitter. I don’t need the app that Sony suggests to download anyway because that is just for ambient and sound control/extras. More convenient if you do use headphones with your phone.Any more cons? I can think of any!Pros: a lot! I love these. I previously purchased cheap Bluetooth headphones from Amazon but wish I have got these sooner. The cheaper ones are ok but the ear pads hurt my ears after wearing them after an hour or two.I’ve only used these Sony headphones a couple times but after an hour my ears don’t hurt! The earpads are comfortable and fit over my ears well.As I said before, it’s easy to connect via Bluetooth transmitter(or whatever blue tooth you are hiking up to) after I deleted the app, if I want to watch tv.It’s hard to tell in the instructions with no words(I guess a con) but I looked it up in you tube, and while the headphones are on, press and hold (the on/off button)until the voice lady says Bluetooth pairing. This is a good tip because I didn’t get that right away. And then it connected!Was easy to reconnect as well using it another day.I can also listen to my tv and have the noise cancelling on and the same time! It’s great! I don’t even hear any traffic from outside or if someone has their subwoofer on in their car! It’s a game changer and a life saver.The noise cancelling is great in general also. And can be turned off if needed by pressing the button over the on/off button. Can also be switched to ambient sound.Overall these are the best headphones I’ve had. And totally forgot how good Sony was. I know back in the day I had a Walkman and cd Walkman and they were the bras knees. The Sony brand has always been good. They are still the best for electronics in my opinion.Another con I just thought of is the changes cord could be longer.Pro: comes with a nice fabric case and plug if if you want it wired an adapter for airplanes, etc.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AGMSTFZ2H4KOB6D42AJN6YH7U6FA,True,9,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only,

R3V25GSVN3M9AR,"4.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED: Excellent sound & Comfort, Subpar Ergonomics, Auto-Shut Off Does Not Work as Expected",Richard N. Barg,4,"Note: this review is substantially changed. I forgot to proofed the initial review.I also own a pair of Bose QC 35s. The XM4s are definitely more comfortable and easier to wear for a longer period of time. They have less clamping and carbon pressure than the QC 35s, which really surprised me. I owned the XM-3s briefly before returning them. The XM4s, in my view, are considerably more comfortable, especially the headband which no longer exerts a downward force. The QC-35s, still being sold, seem ancient. I have also tried the somewhat polarizing Bose 700s. I’m not a fan, but concede, for phone calls, they are revolutionary in the way they use microphones to produce a clear sound even in noisy environments.The DSEE Extreme audio enhancement option does wonders for the sound, especially on audiobooks and podcasts. The rest of the app is spartan and lackluster.The XM4s device pairs very well with Bluetooth (BT) devices such as my iPhone and iPad, now simultaneously although you do lose the ability to use certain Codecs. BT on the XMS blow away the QC 35s in terms of initially connectivity, notably speed, have superior distance/range and duration of Bluetooth signal. Dropouts even next to the microwave oven, are minimal. The ability to connect two devices simultaneously to BT is a game-changer and a massive upgrade from the XM3s.The chat to talk function is useless and annoying and easy to accidentally turn on.The XM4 ssuffer from a lack of dedicated volume control dials. Car manufacturers removed this feature on their Infotainment system, notably Honda, and customers rightly pushed back. And now the volume controls dials are back. The Bose QC-35s, whatever it other shortcomings and dated design, have dedicated rocker switches that are far superior to the touchpad on the XM4s. Among other things they don’t beep when you raise or lower the volume. That beep is annoying and interferes with what you were listening to.In windy or rainy condition, the touchpad is unreliable, often activated by gusts and raindrops with unexpected results. With inclement weather and outdoors, I fall back to my trusty QC-35s.The touchpad suffers from another vice. You can easily invoke fast forward or rewind instead of the touchpad volume controls if your finger lands in the wrong place, which happens periodically by the law of averages. If you are an older adult whose hand motor skills have declined, have tremor, or Parkinson’s, by all means disable the touchpad. I find it somewhat difficult to easily orient the headphones, that is to quickly glean which is the left for the right ear cup when putting them on. Sony could have done a better job with a more conspicuous visual indicator.The phone call experience on the XM4s is superior to the Bose Q3-35s, but substantially inferior to the Bose 700s which blow away all the competition (Full disclosure - have not tested Apple’s new headphones). The active noise canceling on the XM4s seem superior to the Bose QC35s. The use of USB-C to charge the headphones is a vast improvement on Micro-USB.Sony has been, at a minimum, disingenuous, and arguably actively misleading the consumer in representing that the XM4s have auto-shut-off when that feature is enabled. In fact, auto-shut-off ONLY disables the noise canceling feature, which saves battery life, but does NOT turn off but the headphones. If you don’t remember to manually turn them off, you will invariably be greeted at some point with an inopportune “low battery” warning. Sony can and should do better. There is no reason the feature cannot work as represented.The Bose QC 35s, by contrast have a well-implemented auto-shut-off. And its very quick to manually turn them off with a rocker switch. With the XM4s, you have to hold down a button for an interminable 2-3 seconds. I simply plug in my XM4s to USB-C every night to ensure I have a charged set of headphones, How this will affect the battery life long-term is unknown.The XM4 case works, but is a bit weird. You have to do through numerous contortions to fold the headphones in such a way that they fit in the case. The cutout guides are so some helps, but overall the case on the QC-35s is simpler and allows for quickly storing them. The zipper on the Sony XM4s is of an inferior quality and often hangs, requiring you back up the zipper forward progress and start again.Thus I heartily recommend the XM4s, but with some reservations.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2021",AHCZHHNMP4MTYNJLGUE4UHGPLLBA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,

R2V6FCX5P6469V,5.0 out of 5 stars Very Good Headphones,Amazon Customer,5,"These headphones have very good sound quality and feel well made. They arrived in nice packaging, and the carrying case they come with is decently compact and also good quality. I've had them for 1.5 years now, and after daily, extensive use, they are still doing fine. I may have to replace the ear pads in the next year, but that's an easy process and only around $20 for replacement parts. I got these on sale, and I recommend anyone interested wait for a prime or sale day for them to go on sale for like $200. They charge very quickly and last me a good couple days of all-day use on a full charge, even after 1.5 years. I'm not one to go into the equalizer and change stuff, so the basic sound settings sound great to me. The noise cancelling is good on transit and in the office. On transit or airplanes, it's also nice that you can hold your hand to the right ear, and it will enhance any announcements while quieting the music, so you don't have to actually remove the headphones. Noise cancelling in general doesn't do much for talking sounds, but the ear pads cup the ear and head nicely so you can't hear talking much either.One thing I wish they could change is the feedback beep the headphones make whenever you interact with the touch pad on the right ear. I get some people might appreciate it, but I spent a while when I first got the headphones trying to figure out how to turn it off. I got used to it after a month or so, but I had hoped for a bit more customizability. Tap to pause, a quiet beep, tap to play, another beep.

If you don’t wanna hear anything except for a Gentle hmmm. These will be the best thing ever. The price is a little bit steep, but you are paying for some Immaculate headphones. Battery life is amazing I’ve only charged them once. Durability can’t say I haven’t had a long enough. The buttons are pretty easy to use once you get use to it.

R2NRCSDUHP4IOM,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound and Comfort, But Some Reliability Issues",Christopher J. Giannelli,4,"I recently purchased my second pair of these noise-canceling headphones, and I've had enough time to thoroughly evaluate their performance. Here's my take on them:Pros:Comfort: They're incredibly comfortable, even during long listening sessions.Appearance: The black design is sleek and aesthetically pleasing.Build Quality: These headphones feel high quality and durable, built to last.Noise Cancellation: The noise cancellation is nothing short of spectacular. It effectively blocks out background noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience.Multi-Device Connectivity: Being able to connect to two devices simultaneously is a game-changer. It's a convenience that sets these headphones apart from others I've owned.Sound Quality: The audio and music sound quality is exceptional, with rich bass and clear treble that make for an awesome listening experience.Cons:High-Pitched Squealing: My first pair occasionally emitted a high-pitched squealing noise. It was so severe that I had to power them off. Unfortunately, the issue sometimes persisted even after turning them back on, leading me to purchase a second pair.Connectivity Issues: After about a year, my new pair began to experience connectivity problems, suddenly stopping audio playback. The only workaround is to power them off and back on, which is quite frustrating and happens all too often.Not ideal for working out: When doing horizontal exercises, like push ups, bench press, rows, etc. these tend to fall off because of the weight. If you're upright however, these are great. Although I'm not sure how the sweat effects them over time, hopefully that won't damage them?Overall:Despite the drawbacks, I genuinely love these headphones. They offer superior comfort, sound quality, and the unique ability to connect to two devices at once. However, I've encountered reliability issues with both pairs I've owned, from the distressing squealing noise in the first pair to connectivity problems in the second. While I would still recommend them for their outstanding features and performance, I do hope the manufacturer addresses these reliability issues in future models.","Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024",AFFMUCTTNHASAJ3W3YURACQ4ALUA,True,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,

R2SUXCOAV9YSTQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones with minor complaints,Joe k,4,"So I am coming from the Bose QC II, which I thoroughly enjoyed. So that will be the headphones ill compare these to. In terms of sound quality they are pretty neck and neck in this category, but I will give the slight advantage to the Sony headphones because they have an EQ on the app. The Bose headphones I felt had better highs, whereas the Sony headphones have much better lows. the mids really are not that much different in my opinion, although I'm not the best judge because I've only ever really used Beyerdynamics dt770s, so I'm not an audiophile by any means.If you listen to hiphop most of the time like I do, these headphones are great and much preferred over the Bose because of a significantly more punchy bass, like seriously, the Bose hardly have bass. However it isn't just hiphop, I also listen to electronic and a lot of fantasy music, like movie and game soundtracks. And these are fantastic for both.Next I will talk about comfort, this is one of the things I dislike about the Sony headphones, but also, this is entirely preference and head shape dependent. I noticed with the Sony headphones the top part of the headphone will hurt the top of my head in a much shorter time than the Bose headphones. Also the ear cups aren't the most comfortable, as I can feel my ears pressed up against the inside of the cups. In my opinion the Bose headphones are more comfortable here, especially over longer periods of time(I wear these headphones at least 6 hours everyday) But that's not to say the Sony headphones are not comfortable, they are very comfortable, more comfortable than my Beyerdynamic dt770 to be honest. They are just not as good as the Bose QC II's, but both are fantastic in this department. I'm not saying the Sony headphones are uncomfortable, I'm just saying they are more uncomfortable than the Bose headphones in my opinion.Next is design and color. So I really really like the color on the Sony headphones, the greyish looks so clean, and id be lying if I said that was not part of the reason why I switched. In terms of looks I love the Sony headphones way more. They just appeal to me more than the more egg shape Bose QC II's. Also the weight of the headphones is about the same, I think maybe the QC II's were slightly lighter, but its not an issue by any means, they are both really light.One of the things I hate most about the Sony headphones is the touch functionality, its a nuisance, to say the least. To the point where I actively try to avoid using the touch functions, like volume up, down, next song, previous, pause, etc. This is a prime example of putting unnecessary tech functions on a product, sort of like how they put tablets on a fridge now--like why? I way prefer the physical buttons on the QC II's. But I always wear an apple watch, and always have my phone on me so its pretty easy for me to change volume and songs on my watch/phone. But still, on the Bose headphones, I used the physical buttons all the time.A lot of times I will accidently pause the song by readjusting the headphones(readjusting needs to happen semi-frequently when wearing them at the gym), also if I try to use the touch controls --because for some reason I always think maybe this time it will be different. It usually ends up with me accidently swiping forward instead of up which will change the song. It is incredibly frustrating.Battery life is next, and Sony wins by 10 hours here, these are insane. 30 hours is great battery life, and it charges with USB-C rather than the older usb ports on the bose. No complaints here.Honestly, Its sort of hard to give these 4 stars, because they really are incredible, but I think because of the incredibly frustrating touch functionality, and the slightly uncomfortable ear cups I have to dock a star, if I could dock half I probably would, 4.5 is a pretty accurate rating, I would give these a 5 stars if they just removed the touch controls, and fixed the earcups somehow.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2021",AFVRXTQ5UZV3R4X6CIHDRIC676HQ,True,2,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only,

R2L92WEGWE2NY8,"5.0 out of 5 stars Expected them to be great, and they exceeded my expectations.",Marcus,5,"Firstly, the first and finish of these headphones is very well done. They fit snug and comfortable on my head, while wearing my glasses or even a baseball cap.The audio quality for something wireless was surprising, and when paired with LDAC codec on an Android device (I've got a Samsung ZFold 5) you can expect a fulfilling wireless headphone experience. Needless to say, they are still non-comparable with a wired, audiophile grade headphone. I use DT-990s paired to a Soundblaster X G6 at my PC for context. Definitely do not expect that kind of performance.The Sony Headphones app is great and allows for a customized EQ and presets, atmospheric pressure for ANC, speak features, etc. App is easy to use and offers some greatly appreciated features for most if not all users.In conclusion, I feel like they're a great purchase - especially if you can catch them on a sale. I've got no complaints and feel like the value for product is more than worth it for these headphones even at MSRP.Lastly, I do not recommend these for an Apple product user, as you will not be able to take advantage of the LDAC audio codec, which increases audio quality with these headphones significantly! Unfortunately, Apple has not made an effort to include this codec in their audio compatibility.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2024",AFPPLK7P4OSS3OG2PWMMB25VB6YA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R38VMTNJZ250QD,5.0 out of 5 stars A Huge Treat Worth the Money,Savvy Consumer,5,"I've never owned high quality headphones, but when I started an office job after leaving teaching, I knew I wanted something good for conferencing on the phone and for listening to music as I worked. Also, I would use then on the airplane as full headsets are more comfortable than earbuds for me. I was moving into a new career and decided I deserved a treat.Features I love...1) Hold one hand over the right ear when noise cancellation is on, and it will deactivate for when you have to talk to someone in the room briefly. Take your hand away, and noise cancelling resumes.2) Music stops playing / pauses when you remove them and resumes when you put them back on (as long as it isn't too long. They do shut off automatically after a certain amount of time)3) I can be hooked up to my phone and computer at the same time4) Ambient sound mode really magnifies the sound around you, which is sometimes very beneficial5) Very comfortable on the head6) Swiveling ear pieces that fold in. This is why I went with the 4 and not the 57) Noise cancellation. I've tried other high end headphones, and these are just as good if not better.8) Control different options by making different types of swipes or taps on the ear pieces.For my first pair of high tech headphones, I am extremely pleased.

R3SXVEP7ZDKCSF,4.0 out of 5 stars My Take,Amazon Customer,4,"The Sony WH-1000XM4’s is a comfortable pair of headphones, designed for comfort, convenience, and to provide a whole new hearing experience with music and audio. Its base focus is ergonomic meaning it has adjustable bands, a comfortable padding, and smart controls that you can customize to suit your preferences. In March 2021, I was searching for a new pair of headphones for my birthday and this happened to come up. At that time it was priced around $300 but I did some further research and thought that these headphones would be a good investment because for one; I like to listen to music and two; I loved the features.Some of the strong aspects of the Sony WH-1000XM4 include the smart features, the app, customizable controls, battery life, and an ergonomic design for comfort. The smart controls can also be connected with the Sony Headphones App and it can also connect up to two devices at once. There is also a speak-to-chat function meaning that if you are wearing the headphones with music on and you start to talk to someone, it will automatically pause the music for you. Once you stop talking, it will resume the music. Besides this, it also has an ambience, normal, and noise-cancelling mode. It can be switched with the side button. Another one of its strengths is that these headphones have the ability to read the environment. When I used to ride my bike to the park while listening to music, they would switch to ambience mode for me to hear the cars and the music would be on low. As for the customizable controls, you can control the sound elements that you want either to be higher or lower within the app to maximize your listening experience. They also have some presets available but I usually stick with the ones I customize. I used them almost everyday and these are the most comfortable headphones so far. The hold is not too tight or loose. They also have Google Assistant and Alexa Built-In. But my most favorite part about these headphones is that I can change the track, change the volume, or make calls with just a tap or swipe on the right ear. The paddings are comfortable. The battery life on these are 30 hours and just charging for 10 minutes will give you 5 hours.Despite these strengths, there are also some flaws. Sometimes when I talk to someone, having the music stop can become annoying. But I changed the controls in the app so that it does not pause the music. Another flaw is that the microphone on these headphones are not good. I heard that from most of my friends, it sounds muffled and unclear. I have to carry the Apple Wired Earphones if I have a meeting to join because the microphone quality on those are better than the Sony WH-1000XM4 (though I heard that the newest one 1000XM5’s have a better microphone). However, I think it is partially my fault for not setting up the microphone. I also wished they came in more colors.Overall, these are one of the top industries’ best headphones. It is a great investment that will improve your audio/music experience. I recommend it to those who have to study a lot, travel a lot, or maybe those who like to up their music game. For the final grade, I give it an A. Depending on what you look for in headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM4’s are a good investment that will bring value to your lifestyle. Wear it with an outfit and it will also become part of the look.","Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2023",AE3XOTZX4POH3IUEKKHWWSFNO4GQ,True,4,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only,
R3SAGQ8WM36T2B,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound - 1st Class Noise Cancelling,Eyeconic,5,"First a side note. Do NOT order this item for overnight delivery. It is a password protected delivery which means that someone will be at your door at 4:00 AM asking for the magic incantation.I have the comparable Sony earbuds so I knew what to expect. Others will have to contend with micro-printed docs on 5 lb paper and a weird wordless diagram which requires a translation from pantomime to one's native language. HOWEVER, the Sony website has ample documentation in a readable format. Also, you need the Sony headphone app to fine tune the setup.I have acute PTSD, a consequence of gun violence. My building is undergoing major construction in th4e form of concrete restoration. I suspect that, for most people, the noise from the machines is a mere inconvenience. For me that is not the case. It's a pile driver inside my head.My earbuds were doing the job (these products have the best noise-cancelling of any device I have tried). However, they have limited battery life. The headphones solve that problem. I CANNOT HEAR A SOUND FROM THE CONSTRUCTION. Moreover, I have modest hearing loss in one ear. Hearing aids balance things out and the headphone can be worn over the aids.I have a large music collection (mostly jazz and classical) ripped losslessly (flac) to large USB drives. The drives are attached to an Nvidia Shield Pro which is an Android TV device. Bluetooth paired right up, has decent range (not requiring LOS) and connects via LDAC (which is what you want for the best quality). I then use Kodi for playback of music and movies.On the left side is an on-off button and another button that can be programmed via the app. On the right, the side of the speaker is actually a mouse pad which allows you to control both volume and your player (Kodi is imperfect in that regard but it works fine with the app on my phone).The music is flat AS IT SHOULD BE. Competing devices seem to be made for the average 16-year-old, artificially pumping up the bass. If unnatural noise is what you want, there are plenty of IOS and Android equalizer apps. In any event Mr. Mozart sounds like he should. Most jazz includes a bass that comes through exactly as it would in a live performance. Well, not exactly because we experience bass physically as well as through hearing.One final note. These things are big. I have an average-sized head (something my former employees would disagree with). The earpieces are not extended at all and the thing is a bit bigger than my headspace. Also, I wish that they were just a tad lighter.So, in the final analysis, these offer excellent sound reproduction that is accurate, rich and natural. The controls (which include a mouse pad on the right speaker) allow you to control your device and volume. The noise cancellation could not be better. There are no compromises making this a reasonable value.","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2023",AGUUWIFY7DIFIWQRWV2JKBCOWEIQ,True,71,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only,

R2VY38AB0K4XQ8,5.0 out of 5 stars Would recommend,Yanet,5,"I bought these in December so I haven't had these for long. The overall experience is amazing and Ive been loving my music a lot more but the headphones leak noise once you exceed a certain volume so if you're putting them in blast everyone will hear what you're listening to. The only thing I can compare it to are my AirPods pros but between the two I would go with these headphones, you really get to feel the music and feel like you're really there.The headphones feel like you could easily break with a single wrong move or turn them the wrong way, they do provide a case so you're fine putting them in a bag, but it's large and bulky, so if you're carrying a lot of things in your bag it most defiantly will take a lot of your space. I haven't used it for working out but I personally wouldn't because it slides off my head whenever I look down or move too quickly so it does get irritating.Overall I say buy these headphones if you to really change the way you listen to music, if you're a generally a careful person there shouldn't be a reason for them to break, they just feel a little cheap for the price you pay for.

R3P26OHTQWKSVU,5.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfection. Close...but no ciggar!,A VERY private person,5,"This item has everything you'd want to have in a noise cancelling device: great sound, good level of noise reduction. BTW, it does NOT cancel the background noise - it reduces it to very low levels. You might not notice it, though, if you're the kind of person who listens full blast to your rap or metallica music.The headphones work great in an airplane. They successfully knocked off the engines noise, and even attendants' voices on a 5-hour flight to N. Carolina. The headphones come with airplane adapters, so you can hook them up to the airplane's entertainment center. The fit is also good - I didn't feel any pressure points over my ears or on my head, where the headband rests.Where the noise reduction doesn't work well is in windy conditions. If you ride a bicycle, run, or walk in some wind, you will hear the wind no matter how you set up the noise reduction. This is because of the position of the microphones that sample the outside noise - they are at the top of each ear cup (the oval openings), and thus, in the path of the wind.The user can answer a phone call, and have a nice chat over the phone while wearing the headphones. However, (s)he cannot start a call like you can with other dedicated headphones. I don't believe it's a big issue because I check the phone anyway, to see whom I'm calling.The app that comes with it is a great way to customize the headphones. Unfortunately, in order to have some features function, Sony requests some of your bio-metric data by asking you to take pictures of your ears, and send the pictures to Sony for analysis. (You do know, don't you, that the ear shapes are as unique as your fingerprints and eye retina?) In this time and age, when every company is trying to track you even in bedroom, and ""Big Brother"" spies on its citizen everywhere, I won't touch those features with a 10-foot pole if the access to these features is conditioned by giving up my privacy. Your mileage may vary.One of the awesome features of these headphones is their capability to fold. Thus, they fit neatly in their dedicated case, and don't take much space; which makes it easy to travel with them. Although Sony released a newer version addressing the sound issue with the wind, I opted to still purchase these because the newer version does not fold.How much do I like them? Much enough to purchase two sets: one for me, and one for my better half.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2023",AGIG3U6I5HUHSGDT2LWJQP5CUHIA,True,33,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,

In my opinion after using them for a while now I can say they are the best wireless headphones I've ever used. The sound quality is great, including the bass. They have great battery life typically lasting me 2 or more days of use between 6-8 hours a day.

The passive noise canceling is good too however you can still hear those around you and other important things if you are using them while out running errands and whatnot. Then there is the pass through/ ambient sound mode which in my opinion is only use full when you have it set up through the app to turn this one when it detects you talking because it makes everything very loud even amplifying sounds you might not hear or notice without them.TLDR: Amazing headphones if I could give more than 5 stars I would.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2024",AHCCO3CSLWNTYIR3IOXIVDTSVQCA,True,1,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only,

You wont be able to hear computer until you stop/pause or close your phone app. Then if you want to listen to music on phone you need to repeat by pausing computer then playing the phone and it will pick up.

RDLWJ8EVJISYF,4.0 out of 5 stars Great 2nd headphones,Jae Lee,4,"To give you some context: I've had 3 ANC/noise cancelling headphones now. The Sony X4s are my third. I started with a $40 pair of Taotronics. These are great for a budget pair of noise cancelling headphones. I moved up to a more expensive pair of Taotronics 90 (~$80). The Sony XM4 is my third and at this junction, I was looking for the following features:1. Better noise cancelling.2. Better comfort, that I would wear longer than an hour).3. Better sound quality (for music and podcast).4. Portability (for traveling).The Sony XM5 just came out so these XM4 were priced at $228. I'm not used to spending this much on headphones but I'm glad I decided to upgraded to these. I was on the fence about the XM5s but the ability to fold the XM4s up, plus the fact that it was priced much less was all the reason I needed to go with the XM4.Things to note about the XM4s:1. ANC - Noise cancelling is great. It covers more of the frequencies than my previous cheap pairs did.2. Ambient Sound - Ambient noise is pretty bad. When you turn noise cancelling off to talk to someone or to hear the outside world, the sound is hollow. If you want ANC headphones where ambient sound comes through clear, these XM4s are not the best. They have the feature but it's not great. Personally, I just take my headphones off when I need to talk to someone. Otherwise, I only wear these with noise cancelling on.3. Comfort - The XM4s are very comfortable. I can easily wear these for 2 hours+ without any discomfort. I've slept in these too (to help me sleep). The ear cushions are soft and pliable enough where I don't feel any pain points. As other reviewers have mentioned, because it does such a good job with noise cancelling, there will be heat that builds up inside, especially if you're exerting energy or wearing these on a wam/hot day. It's not unbearable; just something to note.4. Sound Quality - Sony has an equalizer you can mess with and it helps to fine tune the how music or speech (ie., podcasts) comes through but it's not as good as some of the higher end headphones. But again, for $228, these headphones are a good deal, especially compared to others in the same class.Note: There are other features like the auto-pause, touch navigation (ie., play/pause/next/prev, and volume), and the hand-over-ear to turn ambient noise on... These work fine for me. I like how it works but I don't consider these as PROs or CONs... They're just different and may be useful based on personal preference.Summary: I would highly recommend these noise cancelling headphones at the current price of ~$228. If you want comfort, portability, slightly better sound quality than other comparable/competing brands, this is a very good choice. If you're coming from cheaper-type headphones, these are a great upgrade. If you're on the fence between a much more expensive pair of headphones AND need a pair of affordable headphones straight away, these are a great option. I will likely purchase another in my lifetime but these will work for me for years to come until one that has better sound quality for music and speech becomes affordable [for me].","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022",AFYCJRL6M67IX6WUPQGN3JQO5ASA,True,4,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,
R1G3YI5M4WH50,5.0 out of 5 stars Oh which to choose the 4 or the 5,Casperi,5,"I chose last year's 4 model because it's more comfortable. Add in deeper headphone pads like wicked Cushion and you can't lose!!!. I tried my friends M5s and they just didn't fit right and they had begun a crack on the left part right before the slider. I have never seen the M4 do this. Trust me I see people drop headphones almost every night at the gym and every brand. The M5s always break in the same spot. I however never seen a set of M4 s break, ever after a lads ex came in and kicked them halfway across the gym room.Comedy aside the M4s sounds great,even better when you pair it with Sonys app to get the EQ and other settings.Bottom line even when I had the choice to buy Sonys M5s the M4s are much better.

RODXFEQLR1YSO,4.0 out of 5 stars Not the best comfort fit for small heads. The hype for noise cancellation is real!,Sarah,4,"I've been looking for some noise canceling headphones and once these went on sale for Prime day, it was a no brainer that these were the headphones to get. Although there's a newer version out, many reviews have continued to praise this version and its ability to fold in on itself and greater adjustments for the ear cups. My goals for a headset were a lightweight, wireless, and noise canceling to use with my PC, phone, and video game consoles. I didn't really plan on using these for traveling since I prefer to travel very light with just some earbuds.Upon first use, I was amazed by noise canceling ability just by putting it on. Even turned off, the ear cups create a great seal around your ears against outside noise. The sound optimizer is amazing and truly does find a great setting to cancel out the most noise taking into account little details like its placement on your head and atmospheric pressure. Many reviews have stated it feels like you get transported to a different place when you use the headphones because it immerses you into your music and although I can see where they are coming from, there were times I were a bit underwhelmed from its noise canceling ability since I could still hear my fan in the background but when I removed my headphones and realized how loud the fan actually is next to me, I was like alright these are pretty good. When I'm working on my desk, sometimes people sneak up without me knowing because the noise canceling is that effective. The ambient noise with focus on voice doesn't do well when someone is talking to me and does become a hassle to remove every time, versus my Samsung earbuds' ambient mode allows me to talk to others without fully removing them from my ears.Sound quality is great in my opinion and the difference is significant from my daily Logitech headphones. I am using Logitech G435s for my PC for its superior light weight and very light pressure against my head, not really for mic and sound quality. While these headphones' 254 grams weight took some getting used to for me coming from a mere 165 grams headset, it is still quite comfortable to use for long periods of time. In the beginning, I was debating if I should return them because they didn't fit as well on my small head as the small Logitech g435s did and the Sonys ear cups put significant uncomfortable pressure against my jaw and side of head, but after using them as my daily for weeks, the pressure loosened and has become a lot more comfortable. I barely feel any discomfort nowadays, but the pressure against my jaw is still present and noticeable. While snug enough to use for work, these are too loose to use on my small head during exercise. They fall off my head very easily and are too warm for me to use during strenuous activity. These are too expensive to risk breaking at the gym. Because my head is a bit too small for these headphones, I have to be more conscious of the headband placement. I find myself readjusting it on my head more often than my previous headset, but this small annoyance wasn't big enough to warrant a return yet.I really like these headphones and the noise cancellation is amazing! Sound quality is great. However, ambient mode for having conversations without removing the headphones is poor. Battery life is great, but I haven't tested it to its limits yet. Touch gestures and use of buttons have worked well for me, no issues. I'd say that the comfort level is a B tier for my small head, but manageable. Heavier than what I'd like. This is where the headphones score the worst for me, but everything else is pretty good and I'm more than happy with this purchase for the price.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2022",AGIYWPZ2FJWADZSWTIUZ5OQLRSHQ,True,7,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only,

R3TUSBANMTQS7N,5.0 out of 5 stars All Inclusive and Fully Delivering,Julian Sanchez,5,"These headphones work perfectly for everything I need them for, be it gaming, work conferencing, or listening to music. The sound quality and customizability is best when used on a phone in conjunction with the app, but it works just fine everywhere else too. I've never received a complaint while on a call with them.I personally listen to plenty of EDM and bass heavy music, and I gotta say that these headphones deliver like none other I've owned. The app again is the most useful in this aspect, allowing full EQ customizing and direct control over the bass quality. Here the noise cancelation can also be set or modes can be set for the adaptive noise cancelation.When the headphones drop the ball a little is when you use a different device which doesn't support the app. At this point they'll default to whatever your last settings were on the app in terms of noise cancelation, EQ, and volume. If you really want to work around this however it's a simple task to pair your phone as the secondary device to the headphones and control them from there while listening to your primary. The auto switch between multiple paired devices depending on audio input is also great, being able to do this fluently was a big factor for me when shopping. Pairing across multiple devices is really easy after the first time paired, most times automatic.The final positive point I'll address is the touch controls on the right ear cup. I've seen many listing this as a fail point for these headphones, and I was hesitant about it at first too due to my previous headphones employing physical buttons. However, I've had no issue with the touch controls and actually find them quite convenient. They're not as sensitive as I've seen some claim, maybe they fixed this in a software patch. I've worn these under a hoodie without triggering the controls.I've been using these almost daily for the past 2 months and I've really only come across two troublesome points. The first is that paradoxically despite having multiple microphones which work during wireless use for calls, when you plug the included aux cable into your device for wired use, the headphones only provide audio and on a call use the connected device's microphone. This was very inconvenient for me as I tried to use the headset in a wired format for game chatting and was held back by the lack of a microphone on the remote, an issue I didn't have with my previous headset. When attempting to make a wired call with my phone in my pocket this became an issue as well for obvious reasons, which is when I first noticed this design.The second issue I've had is one of comfort. Now don't get me wrong these headphones are comfortable and I wear them for multiple hours at a time, but sometimes my left ear enters in discomfort after these extended periods due to the inner design of the left ear cup. As advertised the headphones detect when you take them off and stop playback accordingly, but to accomplish this they use a rather large sensor in the interior of the left ear cup. This sensor ends up pressing against the tip of my ear and becomes annoying after some time, but its not usually an issue and thus not a big enough problem to stop me from wearing them daily for hour long sessions.All in all I fully recommend these headphones as long as the two issues noted above aren't a deal breaker for you. They've served me well and I've felt like I've gotten value for my money.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2021",AHJFFVMMENIBY5VX736WVMJZCHBA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only,

Battery is really good, last a long time and charges fast, i usually have to charge them by day 3 or 4, with usage of about 6-8 hours a day.

RIUMOOIYC2JV8,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful headphones, ESPECIALLY for the price!",Sarah,5,"These headphones are great! I've had them for a little over a month now, and they performed better than I expected!FUNCTIONS: For $20 bucks you can't really beat these. Once you connect it to a device via bluetooth, it will remember those devices and automatically connect to them anytime you turn on the headphones (I believe this only works for up to 2 devices). For example, if I'm working on my iPad and also have my iPhone with me, when I turn on the headphones it will automatically start playing the audio of whichever device I'm currently on (as long as they're connected to the headphones via bluetooth). If I'm listening to a video on my iPad with the headphones, then pause the video and go on my iPhone to watch a different video, I don't have to switch anything on the headphones!!! They'll just automatically switch over to the phone's audio (I believe this function only works for up to 2 devices, because I find that if I'm working on my iPhone+iPad+Macbook, I have to disconnect from one of the two currently connected devices in order to connect to the third device's audio). I'm also able to take phone calls through the headphones since it has a built-in microphone. Honestly for $20 bucks, I did NOT expect this level of functionality!!! Haha.FIT: I haven't faced any issues with the fit of the headphones, they've been quite comfortable for long-term wear. They're very lightweight which is wonderful when trying to avoid fatigue and pain. They're snug but not too tight, and they also have an adjustable strap so you can lengthen them to fit over your ears as needed. I personally try not to be too rough with them since I know $20 can only go so far, and I have seen other reviews of people who faced issues with the quality of the ear padding and such, so my advice would be to just be as gentle as possible with the headphones when taking them on/off or adjusting. I personally don't workout with them and primarily use them in a home/office setting, so I can't speak on the quality once sweat or rapid movements/motion comes into play, which I know for some people would be an important factor to consider!SOUND: Again, for $20 bucks this can't be beat haha. The sound clarity/quality is great, and much better than I expected for the price. You can also change the equalizer with the click of a button which is really nice (it has a certain number of options, I can't remember how many). I would NOT call these headphones completely soundproof or noise cancelling, because you are still able to hear quite a bit of environmental sound, unless you're blasting the volume... which I wouldn't recommend haha. The headphones do drown out a lot of environmental noise, but again, NOT necessarily soundproof/noise cancelling in comparison to other higher priced headphones. Another important thing to note: whatever you're listening to can most likely be heard a bit by people around you. Unfortunately these headphones DON'T isolate the audio very well (unless the volume is very low)...so if you're in a quiet library around others or a place that requires silence, this could likely be an issue!I hope this review was helpful! Overall, these are definitely GREAT headphones for the price!!!","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AFD3HS44VSHQPQ3AY46AD7MNZDKA,True,46,Color: Black,B09LYF2ST7

It worked fine connecting to phones and to Windows 10 computers, so I'm not sure what caused the issue, but getting a new one thankfully showcased it was a bug in the device since my new one works well.I am running into a strange issue where sometimes the audio on computer will get muffled when I open other programs.

R32EE9YQZHPX15,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Value,Debbie Landon,5,"I would consider myself a professional headphonist and these are a steal for under $20. The quality is superb and are extremely light so you don’t even realize you’re wearing them sometimes. They fit the whole ear completely without any pressure on any part of the outer ear and envelope a perfect seal so there’s no need for ANC. Rock EQ setting is best for music listening, but the default Pop setting is good for all types of listening. I wanted to use used these for a full week before reviewing them and they’ve miraculously made it all week on the same initial charge to full when I got them. I also like that it mixes the notifications like “battery low” instead of completely muting the content for such playback. I’ve used them throughout the days connected multipoint to my cell and Windows 10 laptop, being able to make Teams calls at work and listen to podcast and video content after work. One criticism is the Teams app must use the headset-mode setting to work and after a call it takes about 15-20 seconds for the computer to switch back and be able to play headphone-mode content, however playback to the other multipoint-connected device is always instantaneous. Another downside is the +/- buttons should be volume for single momentary press instead of track advance/previous instead of long press, and the swing-out for the earcups are also backwards from what they usually are (usually swing to the rear than to the front). One last downside is if one of the multipoint devices wanders out of range, it does not automatically connect once it comes back into range and must be reconnected manually. Other than that, the sound is very good, the headphones are very comfortable, and I was astonished by the battery life for a set of headphones this feature-rich at this price point. I would highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AGHX2M2UHZXCJCWMSS66RICVSZMA,True,99,Color: Black,B09LYF2ST7
RLT0T5ZDL0545,5.0 out of 5 stars TLDR: Wow,Amazon Customer,5,"The media could not be loaded. Not much of a review writer, but I spent days agonizing over buying these vs something more expensive. Hopefully this will help someone stress less 👍TLDR: Just try them. Get them as a gift even! These are far past anyone’s expectations of $20 head huggers!!!Now… (for longevity, just know I’ve had these since mid December and use them daily)————————————These are so great… hands down. They aren’t gonna blow you away as they are only $20-23’s, but I also have SkullCandy Crushers evo, Apple AirPod pro 2s, and random other wired buds and THESE are by far my favorite.Pros:-1 I can wear these 24/7. They are feather light; not in a cheaply-made way, but in a very intentional way. I can actually FORGET I have these on. Really. The AirPods hurt after several hours or even start to slide out. My Crushers literally hurt just to put them on and I have a tiny head! But THESE!!! They are such a joy to wear!!!-2 The Bluetooth connection just WORKS! I cannot understand how THESE headphones accomplish this when Apple and SC cannot!Apple pairs fine, but then randomly starts playing sound from another device all the time. Messing with settings is irritating and still it just starts playing audio from random iOS drives in the house! On the other hand, the Crushers have to be cleared in order to connect to a new device. Every time. I almost sent them back cause I assumed they were broke, but no. Apple struggles with it and you have to “forget the device” every single time you want to say, go from your phone to an iPad (then back again). It’s madness. Some big brain thought this was a good idea.. These $20 ones; you power them on and BAM it connects and STAYS connected! If it doesn’t automatically connect, I just tap the name and it’s instant. 🤯-3 The mic is fantastic. I’ve only used it in my home, but ppl tell me it’s crystal clear.-4 The easy eq on the side! No apps to download etc. just push it and it cycles through predetermined settings. And these settings actually make a diff. If you want to listen to an instrumental track, don’t leave it in “bass” setting cause you will automatically think it’s the headphones and they are garbage. NO! Shame on you for blaming them lol-5 I’m not sure how to describe it as I’m not knowledgeable in audio devices (audiophile?), but what I also love about these is the spacial depth of sound. Some music just has the ability to surround you with these things in a way no other devices does. Even the AirPods with “spacial audio” can’t seem to replicate these “vast” atmospheric sounds at times. Of course this also relies heavily on the audio, but wow.-6 They fold so well. At first you might think, these things are flipping around everywhere and going to break.. nope. They just effortlessly fold in on themselves. I am rough on headphones too as a busy mom. They get tossed in my giant mom-backpack daily with no case or cover, squished between iPads etc and they are holding up like a champ!-7 I clean house in them for hours in the day and make/take calls as well. Not once have I received a low battery warning. They also have USB-C!!!!! For $20 I wouldn’t have expected that, and they charge incredibly fast.-8 The price. Omg the price lol I just spent more than $20 at McDonald’s.-9 They come packaged SO nice. It’s no iOS unboxing experience, but ordering anything online has me jaded lately. I fully expected these to just be in a plain box with some Chinese wording, with lots of bubble wrap, but no. It comes in a simple, well made, cardboard cube, but it has bright colors and a presentation value that’s hard to get online with cheap electronics.-10 the giant L/R on the inside! I never realized how many times I have flipped headphones and ear buds all around to figure out which was left ear and which was right. I never even knew I needed this in my life! It’s just another little detail that they didn’t HAVE to even bother with, but the details on these things seemed to matter to the designer and/or company.CONS:-1 They don’t get loud enough for me. Going from AirPods shooting sound waves into my ear canal and Crushers literally made to rattle from bass, directly to these can be frustrating as I have to just put them on max volume immediately. Is it a drastic volume issue? Absolutely not in my opinion. It’s just the ONE thing for me keeping these from being a god-tier S++++++ rating. Hell, this might even be considered a PRO feature, as I’m sure all my other devices are chipping away at my hearing one day at a time…-2 There IS no second con lol seriously.Conclusion:I have a white pair, bought my husband the black pair and am about to purchase my teen a pair. THAT is how much I love these and why I just HAD to write a literal essay about the brand.","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2024",AHEMBQOYIJ5F3HH6C55XYJTBGDQA,True,294,Color: Black,B09LYF2ST7

But if you're in a bind, they do work for calls, just make sure to speak loudly and clearly so the mic actually picks up your voice.• As a non-bluetooth user, battery seems OK. I've never had to charge it after the first charge and every time I have wanted to use wireless, they've been charged.• I like really really loud music, and I don't feel like these get up to the volume level I crave - which is probably a good thing, health-wise.• They have fairly good passive noise cancellation, which I didn't know they had before purchasing.

R3F2VX5ZGBB03M,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow GREAT Value,Demesa,5,"I purchased several brands to compare & contrast - Sony, Apple, & these Beribes. Guess which one I kept? The cheapest ones!! because they are just as good for a fraction of the price. (Although I am not a stickler for sound quality )The battery is God tier. I have never run out, I just have moments where I think ‘hey I Haven’t charged these in a while maybe I should plug them in.’ Since I’ve never reached the limit on battery I can’t say for sure, but I would say it’s more than five days. Maybe even 7. The Sony ones lasted less than a day.They are comfortable. They aren’t too tight on my head which I am very sensitive to because of my migraines. If I have a ponytail in for too long I will get a headache so the headphones have to be comfortable or it’s a dealbreaker. I have fallen asleep in these which is absolutely unheard of for me. I think I have a really sensitive head. When I first took them out of the package and put them on I was thinking they weren’t going to work because they felt a little uncomfortable but after I adjusted them andused them for a while I no longer have that issue. I can wear them all day and only have the slightest bit of fatigue on my head. It usually goes away in about five minutes and then I can put the headphones back on. Setting them up with Bluetooth was easy. I’m not an audiophile so the sound may not be up to some standards but it is just fine with me. Use them to listen to music, Netflix, YouTube, podcasts, and to drown out my upstairs neighbors who I think are running a day care bc all I hear all day and night is running back and forth across the apartment. Nonstop. I wish I was exaggeratingThe plastic components don’t feel particularly cheap although they didn’t have that heavy feel of the more expensive ones. But I think that might be a plus for me. Less weight probably equals less fatigueI don’t think you would be disappointed w these unless you’re a musician or need them for work. But for ppl like me they are perfectly fine. More than fine. I paid less than $25 and I don’t think you can beat that for what you’re gettingI hope all these positive reviews dont result in a hike in price. I don’t think you’ll find a better pair of headphones for the money. Thinking of buying a back up because all the good quality items sell out and disappear.(However I could definitely see myself looking these up on eBay and buying a pair:)Try them!Hope this was helpful. If anything changes I will always update my review. I’m writing this on May 25th 2024.

R1FPC4HJGA1TOP,5.0 out of 5 stars Budget-Friendly Bluetooth Bliss: My Surprising Headphone Discovery,Joe,5,"These $20 headphones have really blown me away in terms of quality and functionality. Once I connected them to my devices via Bluetooth, they automatically remembered them and now seamlessly switch between devices.The Bluetooth connectivity with up to two devices is such a helpful feature. I often find myself juggling multiple devices, so it's great to be able to easily transition the audio between them using these headphones.Another pleasant surprise is the built-in microphone, which allows me to take calls directly through the headphones. I didn't expect to get that kind of functionality at this price point, but it's been incredibly useful.Honestly, for just $20, the quality and capabilities of these headphones are remarkable. I had some issues, but the customer service team was quick to help resolve them.I can't recommend these headphones enough. The seamless multi-device Bluetooth, decent sound quality, and added features like the microphone make them an unbeatable value. I'm thrilled with my purchase and think anyone in the marker for affordable, high-performing headphones should give these a look.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AFDPEPHGNQ57CMJIK7EMXSXAF54Q,True,0,Color: Black,B09LYF2ST7
RI6PV0ULWXEZR,4.0 out of 5 stars Not Bad!,RANDAJOE,4,"I bought these in lieu of my previous favorite pair of headphones breaking (I snapped the band which was reinforced plastic) in hopes that these would hold up during my online classes better while I repaired the other one. The metal band is very strong and I feel secure wearing them. These are really comfortable around the ears and the speaker rims are nice and big so they completely wrap around the earlobes instead of resting directly on top of them (which is something I've noticed with other over-ear headphones and can be very uncomfortable wearing after a while). The battery life also lasts a loooooonnng time (I use them for around 8 hours a day, longest I went without charging was a week), so it's perfect to take anywhere. Only thing I don't like as much is the bass quality since the headphones aren't as tight as I'd like them to be, so it sounds farther away. This can be easily fixed with some settings and an equalizer to increase the bass though if you have a smaller head shape like mine. It pairs well with all my devices except for my Mac (doesn't appear in settings), but it can still be connected with an earphone jack if you have a similar problem. Overall great quality for the price, love the color too!","Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2024",AF722SIDY6EFCDGNXC3RBOFR4BMA,True,1,Color: Green,B09LYF2ST7
R1THVJMWY79ZIL,4.0 out of 5 stars Tight Fit But Top Notch Audio,Crissy,4,"Had these for over half a year. The sound was unparalleled. Had to break them in a bit because they came a bit tight on arrival but after that, was smooth sailing. They connected to my laptop easily and they charged really quickly too and each charge would last me 2 or 3 days with intermitttent use.The swiveling got annoying because it swivels pretty on its own quite often the moment it's off your head. The folding was useful since I had to cram into tight spaces sometimes too.After quite a bit of manhandling, I made a mistake and broke my pair of these recently and I've regretted it ever since. If you end up liking these headphones and need a replacement, do youself a favor and just buy another pair of them. Even the upgraded version of these didn't have sound that compared to this version. It'll give you a lot more bang for your buck than you'll ever know.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AF5O26NSWQP6W6NJVFJJZLA7RWDA,True,1,Color: Black,B09LYF2ST7

The bass can get as grooved as you want, same with phone calls. Battery life could be a bit more reliable, but the performance is worth it for traveling or chilling out after work to avoid roommates. The white is solid, love it.

These come close but the headphones are just a bit too small. They're still comfortable, but if you have a large noggin (and likely bigger ears) they might seem a bit snug. I only use them for traveling, so maybe if I wore them daily I'd get more comfortable with them. The audio quality is pretty good - nothing comparable to high end brands, but I easily drowned out cabinet noise on my flight.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AHGYJK4QLVXTJPQJ3SQNID25MGFA,True,1,Color: Black,B09LYF2ST7

R3IL54Z7QA8JAS,4.0 out of 5 stars They work well,Mike,4,"I gave this rating a little less than 5 only because:(1) These headphones are somewhat difficult to connect / pair (I am not sure why - BUT - They do connect with a little work). Working with Microsoft & HP, I had to purchase a third-party Bluetooth device ASUS USB-BT500 that simply plugs into a computer USB socket (It works).(2) If you shut them OFF and turn them ON again, they come on with FULL volume. I would like them better if they came on at MID volume - OR - The volume at which they were shut off. SO - I leave them turned ON for my computer. I could leave the charging cable connected - BUT - They only seem to loose 10% power per day - SO - I may only need to charge them once-a-week.(3) 2-WEEK UPDATE: I have been using them for a couple of weeks now on my HP DeskTop computer (pairs well with my HP LapTop computers & iPhone). I have kept them turned on 24/7 for one week (Like I said, turning OFF & ON, they start ""FULL volume"" - Not good). Anyway, keeping them turned on and using them 24/7 for a week - not charging - still shows 40% charged after 7-days (168 hours). Maybe if I played music 24/7 for a week may show less charge - BUT - They work great for me.(4) Oh, one more thing, the ""6 music modes"" don't change much for my OLD ears - Sound is GREAT.","Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2024",AGXCMMU7JZC7SKYWKNYBD4GFFFFA,True,5,Color: Black,B09LYF2ST7

I even went and ordered their JBL Clip 4 speaker as it is water proof and dust proof. So far so good! These are fantastic and pretty durable! I like that they fold flat for storage as well.

RMAOYF9V6ORGD,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid Performance with a Few Shortcomings,Art Bowen,4,"The JBL Tune 510BT Wireless On-Ear Headphones aim to blend the convenience of Bluetooth connectivity with JBL's signature Purebass sound. Here's a quick dive into what they offer and where they might fall short.Living up to the JBL reputation, the Tune 510BT delivers impressive sound quality for its price point. The Purebass technology ensures that bass lovers will not be disappointed, offering deep and powerful lows without overwhelming the mids and highs. However, audiophiles might find the sound profile a bit bass-heavy, affecting the balance for certain genres of music.The medium-sized, on-ear design is both a blessing and a curse. While the headphones are lightweight and relatively comfortable for short to medium listening sessions, extended use can lead to some discomfort, particularly for those not used to on-ear models.With up to 40 hours of playback time, the JBL Tune 510BT stands out in its category. This extensive battery life is ideal for commuters or those who forget to charge their devices regularly. The quick charge feature is also a nice addition, providing hours of playback with just a few minutes of charging.Bluetooth pairing is straightforward and reliable, with minimal dropouts. Multi-device connection is a useful feature, allowing you to switch between devices effortlessly. However, the absence of advanced Bluetooth codecs may affect the audio quality slightly, especially in noisy environments.The headphones sport a sleek design and come in a vibrant blue color, which will appeal to users looking for stylish options. While the build quality is decent for the price, the plastic construction may raise durability concerns over long-term use.Offering a solid combination of sound quality, battery life, and wireless convenience, the JBL Tune 510BT provides good value for those in the market for mid-range wireless headphones.The JBL Tune 510BT headphones are a respectable choice for casual listeners and bass enthusiasts looking for wireless freedom. While they excel in sound and battery life, potential buyers should consider comfort and build quality. These headphones are well-suited for everyday use, especially for those prioritizing battery life and bass performance.","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AHPB4PHXMXB6IAITGNVI4DXO6D3A,True,104,Color: BlueStyle: headphones,B08WM3LMJF

Super sturdy, long battery life, and great sound quality!",Kristina,5,"I purchased these headphones in November 2022 and am finally putting them to rest today, May 2024.I got them on sale for $25 for studying as I started my graduate program.PROS:1. Personally, I don't like 100% noise-canceling headphones because I like to be aware of my surroundings and if people are trying to talk to me. But they cancel ENOUGH of background noise to keep my ADHD attention span in check. So if you want to completely ignore the world, these may not be for you. The sound quality is very loud and clear, and the volume doesn't have to be turned up that much, either.2. SO DURABLE. I am surprised these lasted for as long as they did. I was waiting for them to crap out a year ago with how I was using them. I take them to the gym; sweating on the ""earmuff"" part was kind of gross, but I cleaned it with alcohol after, and it still held up great. These have also been my go-to for traveling. I've brought them on many plane rides, fallen asleep with them in weird angles, shoved them in many PACKED backpacks and suitcases, and have been dropped quite a bit. STILL WORKED AND SOUNDED BEAUTIFULLY.3. Battery life is nearly immortal. I forget to charge these because of how long they last. I used them all week to study, maybe 4-5 hours a day, 5 days a week, and would charge them every two weeks or so.4. I also use these for work calls and Zoom meetings, and they have worked better than any of my expensive Galaxy Buds or whatever Anker earbuds.CONS:1. Mishapen. I'm not even mad about this. Maybe I have a big head or maybe it was all the roughhousing its gone through, but the band area is a little stretched but expected for normal wear and tear.2. $50? Got too popular and expensive for poor grad students like me.TLDR;; Buy these!

R3JGFPUPZDIFUB,4.0 out of 5 stars They fit too tight...,Arrow Flyer,4,"These are not properly size to fit well. The clamping pressure on you ears is too high. So, I could not wear them for long. I fixed that with a short length of 1/8"" steel rod from a home center or hardware store and two zip ties (wire ties). this flattens out the top curve of the headband, spreading the ear cups apart and that removes the pressure. When you do that, the ear cups will be riding higher on your head so you may have to compromise. Adjusting the pressure is easy. You just slide the zip ties in for tight and out for loose.Now that I have that problem under control I like them very much. The battery runs for a long time and recharge time is well under an hour. They automatically sleep after a while so I don't even bother shutting them off.

These are light weight and comfortable and have just enough noise cancelling abilities to make me feel immersed but still aware of my surroundings, which is a must for me!

For instance my blue tooth on desktop is faulty and using the C charger to connect to the computer doesn't work for anything but charging.The sound is good. The headset stays on when I bend over (which is not always true of other brands). The padding is comfortable. I would definitely consider JBL for future purchases.

R350RH0BWMBO33,5.0 out of 5 stars Want ANC Headphones with $$$ sound but under $60? These deliver that & more IMHO UPDATE Dec 2023,Carolina,5,"Update Dec 2023- These headphones are still as awesome as the day I received them in 2019! Ankar is truly hard to beat. Just in case you’re looking for a pair I can vouch for the quality of these.I’ve had these headphones since end of December 2019, gotten for flight over the holidays. Tried out both Bose noice Cancelling headphones at local brick & mortar store, but the price caused me to pause. On to Amazon where I found these, better price, would arrive before my flight, sounded like a deal worth a shot after reading everything about them what did I have to lose with Amazon’s return policy & Anker’s reputation for quality.I’ve had great chargers, other electronic items by Anker with great results. They arrived on time well packaged, impressive from the start, but sound quality sealed the deal.Back to Anker headphones, I love them! The sound quality is amazing, when I have ANC on I can’t hear anything but music, the outside noise is indeed cancelled. Even on my really bad flight (another story) a guy wanted to test them against his B newest headphones, so we switched for a test. He said he wish he had known about Ankers quality & price, they were impressive not that he would give up the B set, but would definitely buy them as a spare or an extra pair to use for other activities, he couldn’t believe the price. He went straight to Amazon asked me if the pair he chose were the same as mine, they were & he ordered them. That kind of confirmed I have a great pair of anc headphones & didn’t pay $$$ for them,They pair easily and are comfortable - until I’ve worn for hours then my shades/glasses are indented in my skull, time for a break, but that’s after hours of wearing-enjoying great sounding music 4-6 hrs & battery is still strong, time fly by.There are only 2 minor suggestions for Anker regarding these headphones 1) add to Soundcore app please (after thought I don’t know if it’s needed unless to customize equalizer) the volume can be controlled on the headphones. 2) the headband could use a slight redesign. Wearing them while working out, doing lawn work or inside cleaning, cooking, always moving about (excellent BT range btw), the top of headband pulls my hair as the headband is adjustable it tends to slide a wee bit & my hair gets pulled so I have to adjust them & keep going, I’ve no idea how they could do this it’s something I noticed when trying out my son's. He bought a cheap pair of JBL headphones for lawn mowing, they do fit a little better but don’t compare to Ankers sound quality, imho Would love JBL type fit on Anker Life Q20 hybrid ANC headphones!Taking phone calls while wearing headphones works great, I asked how did I sound, fine he said, then we laughed when I told him I was listening to music on my Ankers when he called & I took the call while wearing my headphones. Neither of us had any problems with quality of call. Volume is easy to find & adjust the multifunction button is easy to use for music or calls.They come with the charging cable, though I wish more companies included the wall plug in,I don’t always have a spare just ling around, ok so I never have a spare just laying about. Also the aux cable is included though I haven’t used that feature yet. A drawstring pouch to put them in, which was good as I didn’t have a case to put them in for my flight & no time to get one. Instructions are well written Anker products are always first classLove these headphones, the ANC & overall sound quality at this price point is a gift that keeps on giving. The quality of this model looks & sounds like the much higher price headphones, maybe better than some. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy for a gift as they come gift wrap ready or a gift of music for me.Overall Ankers entry into the headphone, earbud market is welcomed. I wouldn’t hesitate to try them out if you’re looking for headphones with ANC Fantastic sound, that doesn’t break the budget to tears, give them a listen I think you’re going to love them.Simply put my Anker Life Q20 ANC headphones are fantastic in quality and sound. I’m not an audiophile but I can’t find a thing disappointing in these, not quality or sound. I like a variety of music & I hear good bass, mid tones & treble, vocal it’s all there. As said for everything including quality these headphones deliver at a price that doesn’t break the bank & with Ankers outstanding customer service is amazing. I can honestly say Anker SoundCore is definitely impressive, just as their charging cables, & other electronic devices that was my first introduction to Anker products. I’m sure I’ll look at their Bluetooth speakers soon.Sorry for overly long review, there’s so many outstanding elements that I feel are important for customers to know when spending your money,I try to offer as much info I’ve experienced as possible, I’ve relied on Amazon customer reviews when making a purchase, they’re brutally honest good or bad & I appreciate that.I’ve had & used these headphones since late 22nd December, tonight is 25 July enough time to really evaluate them, they’ve exceeded my expectations, I would definitely recommend, most of all I would buy them again.Thanks if you did read this long review, good intentions to help others as they shop. UPDATE 12 August a friend of mine used my Ankers while visiting. He called back he had received his very own Anker Life Q 20 headphones. That says a lot about the sound & quality whilst respecting the customers wallet, he was so happy with his new headphones & that I recommended Ankers.Thanks again to Amazon shoppers, Amazon & AnkerUPDATE: if you’ve read my review you know I’ve had this set of headphones since Dec 2019 it’s Nov 29 2023. I thought I would need to replace them this week but not so fast! Removed them from the pouch they came with, paired with new iPhone and wore them while preparing dinner continuing until bedtime always after midnight. The quality of sound, the hours of comfort while carrying on with everything needed to be done, the joy of listening to many genres of music was fantastic even taking a call.In 2019 I think there was 1 color choice, sure I’d loved to have had the choices Anker has today but I didn’t buy them as a fashion statement but for the Anker quality, outstanding customer service in every product they put the Anker name on. These headphones have not diminished in sound quality whether I’m jamming as I go through daily chores, or taking or making phone calls while wearing this same pair of headphones.In this current economic environment I’m thrilled for Anker’s dedication to quality while delivering headphones that are affordable. And providing a fantastic choiceI wanted Amazon shoppers to know they have a choice if shopping for headphones that doesn’t sacrifice sound or quality or lasting performance. When I’m looking for another set of headphones or the Anker Liberty Air EarPods or the many chargers I’ve bought, I always look for Anker/Soundcore first I know the quality and their outstanding customer supportThanks everyone Happy Shopping","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2020",AFSQEHFGI4GKAV6ZLXDEBCO5FQPQ,True,370,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R1BQMJJBRP2JKK,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and noise cancellation for and unbeatable price,Ollie,5,"I have never owned a high-end Bose or Sony noise cancellation headphone so understand the context of my experience.My use case is commuting on Amtrak while also using those hours to work, and at home, drowning out outside music and neighbors loudly chatting. This Q20 performs perfectly for my needs. All the background noise on the train is barely audible and the sound quality of music and lectures is perfect as far as I'm concerned. One weakness is that voices are still relatively clear due to background noise being muted.In comparison to the Beats Studio Pro which I previously used and costs 3x as much, the Q20 is superior in sound quality, noise cancellation and comfort. The Q20 also presses evenly around the ear while the Beat Studio Pro exerts more pressure on the lower end of the headphone and presses harshly against the jaw while less on the upper end. Very uncomfortable at least for me. Q20 is the entry level and with an entry level price but outstanding performance. I've wondered if I should have purchased the Q30 or 45 but considering the comparison with Beats, I'm extremely happy with the Q20. Per some of the other reviews regarding build quality, I do handle mine gently though.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AHGYTRNPF27FJ5DP2NZIJQEFBU7Q,True,9,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
RMO3BYL4R5F6X,4.0 out of 5 stars Good budget headphones,Justin,4,"I bought these because I wanted a cheap (inexpensive) set of headphones for the gym to replace my AirPods Pro. I was getting tired of fiddling around with the silicone wing attachments for the AirPods.The quality of these Q20’s seems pretty decent and they are comfortable, though I haven’t worn them for an extended period of time.The sound quality isn’t as great as what you would expect from a more expensive set of headphones, but that was to be expected and they sound pretty good for the price.Noise cancellation in general is pretty weird to me, so I’m not sure how good or bad it is in these Q20’s when it works, but I wasn’t impressed. When I tested it sitting in my room, it did a decent job at drowning out the ambient noise like the hum of my fan, etc. I did notice that ANC does reduce the volume a bit.However, at the gym I felt like the ANC was struggling to work properly. While I was on the stationary bike, it kept alternating between drowning out the ambient noise and letting it through. It sounded as if I was lifting one of the ear cups and then setting it back over my ear repeatedly. Didn’t notice it too much after that, but not sure if I just got used to it.The bass boost feature does add a little more thump to your music but sacrifices audio clarity, so I definitely wouldn’t use it.Overall, these are a decent pair of headphones for $40, audio quality is good, ANC is alright, and they are comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AHJQELHY4ARFZHT5HDCBSP3UVGQQ,True,11,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R38XUNRK6U9DLP,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent product with good sound quality and noise cancel and battery life but with just one flaw,Fani,5,"This is a fantastic product. I bought it because I wanted something for my flight overseas to reduce the plane hum noise which drastically reduces jet lag.So I bought this and I was amazed how great it wasPros:* great construction, feels sturdy* good choice of colors* came with USB charge cable and regular 3.5mm (I think) jack wire so it plugged into all audio out* bluetooth pairs fast and easily* noise cancelation is excellent* sound quality overall is just amazing* the thing goes over your ears nicely without hurting your ears or making it feel like it's on fire after an hour. It has soft padding and cushioned so it really helps* you feel the whoosh -> reduced sound as soon as you put it over your ear and it auto-enables noise cancel when you power it on which is great and tells you ""Battery high"" etc. which is great* battery life is amazing. Charged it once for like 2-3hours to max and it worked for 15hr flight to and another 15hr flight back and it still said Battery high. I didn't use it all the time. Maybe for like 60-70% of the time which is still great* colors are nice and make it look classy.* it doesn't cause any issues with the band over the head* you can use it wired without needing to power it on so it uses extremely little battery* the controls are fine and the ear muffs are labeled R and L which is a nice touch* haven't tested bluetooth range but I figure it is maybe standard of working across a large room* price is very good for the performance. Sure it is not a Bose ($350+) or JVC ($200+) or some others but for $40-$50 this is truly fantastic.Cons:* the one and only con I found is if you plug in the audio jack the noise cancelation turns off immediately which is a shame. So on the plane I was watching a movie where the audio came in nicely but I could hear the little plane hum as well (it was muted but not noise canceled).Other:* didn't test the bass boost but I'm sure it is great.Overall, I liked it so much I bought 2 of them. My teenage son loved it too and he said they're really great quality and works well.

R15YTZVPTWKV6S,5.0 out of 5 stars Best budget friendly gym headphones,Landon,5,"I've been using the Soundcore Q20 headphones for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality and noise cancellation, all at a fraction of the cost of more premium brands.The sound quality is outstanding, with deep bass and clear mids and highs. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio is consistently crisp and immersive.The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature works remarkably well, effectively drowning out background noise in a variety of settings. It's perfect for commuting, working in noisy environments, or just enjoying some quiet time.The headphones are lightweight and very comfortable, even during extended use. The ear cups are well-padded and provide a snug fit without being too tight. The overall design is sleek and modern.Battery life is another standout feature. I can easily get up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge with ANC off, and around 30 hours with ANC on. Charging is quick and convenient with the included USB-C cable.Considering the price, the Soundcore Q20 offers incredible value. It competes with much more expensive models in terms of performance and features.If you're looking for high-quality, budget-friendly noise-cancelling headphones, the Soundcore Q20 is an excellent choice. It delivers superb sound, effective noise cancellation, and great comfort, all at an affordable price point.

RHOPBCTZD9LDU,5.0 out of 5 stars Unbeatable Price:Performance!,Joel,5,"I've had the Soundcore Q20 headphones for almost a month now, and I thought I'd start off my review with one simple statement: I've only charged these things ONCE since I've taken them out of the box. These headphones have absolutely phenomenal battery life. The only reason I charged them was because I wanted to test how long they would last on a full charge (within my day to day use). I received these headphones on the 1st of April. It is currently the 27th of April and the battery is still at ""Medium"" (there is no visual indicator, however there is a voice that tells you whether your battery is ""High"", ""Medium"", or ""Low"").That being said, I'll go ahead and list some Pros:- Battery Life (Seriously, I can't stress enough how good it is)- Sound Quality- Comfort- Looks- Sturdiness/Build Quality- Noise Cancellation (there's a caveat here, continue reading to see what I mean)BATTERY LIFE:As if I haven't already said enough, these headphones refuse to die. I've used them from anywhere between an hour to 3-4 hours at a time (long gaming sessions or binging a show on my laptop or phone), and they just don't let up. Like I mentioned in the intro, it's been almost an entire month with these headphones and I've only had to charge them once. It is worth mentioning that the battery will drain much faster with noise-cancelling turned on, as it is indeed ACTIVE noise-cancelling and uses more power. I've got to give props to Anker for marketing these as lasting 40 hours, as this runtime is more accurate when noise-cancelling is ON. With ANC off, these can easily last 60+ hours. It's always refreshing to see a company slightly under-sell and over-deliver.SOUND QUALITY:These things sound way better than they should at this price-point. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do have experience with over-ear, closed-back studio headphones (I own a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's), and dabble in amateur sound mixing/mastering as a guitarist. Apart from being just a bit heavier on the bass than I would like, these headphones do an excellent job at bringing out lows, mids, and highs in pretty much anything you'll find yourself listening to. Nothing sounds drowned out or overexposed (with the exception of the bass, but there's a valid reason for it in this case). I bought these headphones primarily for multimedia consumption (movies, video games, music, etc.). They have just the right amount of punch in the low-end to make things such as explosions or bass-heavy sound effects really shine. In this instance, the heavier low-end makes sense. Voices sound crystal clear, as the mids don't get drowned out by the lows or highs like on some other higher-priced headphones (looking at you, Beats..). The highs are where these things truly shine, in my opinion. Lots of budget headphones tend to sound very ""tinny"" with harsh, sharp highs to over-compensate for the overly-saturated bass, but these do a great job at keeping both the mids and highs prominent enough (despite the thicker bass).COMFORT:I've owned and used plenty of both over-ear and on-ear headphones over the years, and I can't beat around the bush here: these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. I was expecting to have to ""break them in"", given what some of the other reviews were saying, but the minute I put these on I was pleasantly surprised at just how soft and light these felt (without feeling cheap or flimsy). And I wear glasses!LOOKS:Not a whole lot to say about how these look. I wouldn't say you'll be turning heads while wearing these out and about, but for the amount of money that they cost.. I'm just saying they could've looked a lot worse. I've seen headphones three times the price that are a complete eye-sore. The Q20s are clean and minimalistic, without giving away its low price.STURDINESS/BUILD QUALITY:Although I'm not one to man-handle my devices (no matter how little they may cost), I have to say that these don't feel the least bit flimsy. I did a mild stress-test by stretching both ear cups apart as far as I was comfortable with and was able to get about 10 inches wide. I don't think anyone has a head that wide, but if you do, these are definitely going to fit. The build quality feels great, and I feel like these will definitely last a while (and I will be updating this review if that changes lol).NOISE CANCELLATION:These headphones do indeed have active noise cancelling, BUT.. I literally almost NEVER use it. Here's why: they don't need it. The headphones are built in such a way that even with the ANC off, they drown out a ton of outside noise. Unfortunately, there is a significant drop in volume when noise-cancelling is activated. The bass takes a hit as well, making it more evened out with the mids and highs (which might be a plus for some).FINAL THOUGHTS:There's only really one ""Con"" that I wasn't going to mention, and that's the carrying bag that comes with the Q20s. There's nothing really wrong with it, but I did just want to note that they used to come with a hard carrying case (according to some older YouTube reviews), and I'm a little salty that us newer buyers don't get that lol. All in all, for the $60 that I paid for these headphones, I can't think of any reason not to fully recommend them. They sound great, the battery life lasts incredibly long (almost to a suspicious degree, making you feel like today is finally the day it'll need a charge only to be proven wrong), it's got decent looks, solid build, and they even threw in Active Noise Cancellation for situations that call for some extra silence. If you're in the market for some new headphones for multimedia consumption (I definitely would not use these for any professional work, as they are not made for that), and have a bit of a stiffer budget, look no further. These will do more than its price tag leads on.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2023",AG2IY3MWQWDS3BEK37557MIKDP2Q,True,544,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R3HQTCIS9L4E3N,5.0 out of 5 stars Great performance and comfort for transcribing,Krista,5,"I've had these Soundcore Anker LQ20 headphones for a year and have been using them heavily the entire time. They're still going strong and I love them. They're comfortable and the noise cancellation is good. I work from home as a transcriptionist, and I use them for a few hours to several hours a day. They do a good job of blocking or significantly reducing background noises like TV, a noisy AC, lawn mowers, and nearby semi-loud voices. If you use the button to turn off the active noise canceling feature, you'll hear the difference right away.This pair was my first time trying bluetooth headphones for transcribing. I wasn't sure if the sound quality would be as good as wired headphones/good enough for me to accurately transcribe all speech from the audio files I work with, including ones with difficult audio, and I also wondered if there would be any issues with the bluetooth connection being spotty or something. They have worked perfectly and I find them to be very good transcription headphones.I have to charge them fairly often since I use them so much, but I think they have at least average battery life between charges. I usually charge as soon as I notice the voice says ""Battery medium"" at startup because I've learned they'll probably run out in the middle of my work session if I try to wait until it says ""Battery low."" I don't think I've ever even heard ""Battery low.""Great headphones, reasonable price, no complaints.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AGS2HV55N4RN6XK44IT7I5KYHFUA,True,8,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R1L3WIHPNVR4FI,"4.0 out of 5 stars Awesome, but maybe wont last as far as build",Jerry Adams,4,"I purchased 2021. Now in 2024 they are starting to break down, it started with band plastic part randomly breaking off. Now the fake leather is starting to peel pretty bad. There are a few factors that could be causing this. 1. I dont store them in the pouch it came with (its my jewelry bag now). 2. I had them hanging on my office desk near my humidifier which i would put essential oils in. And 3 the headphones were in the sun often because my desk was near a window and i live in California.Despite all that this year was the 1st year i used them on an airplane and watched Dune for the 1st time. Noise cancelling was on point, and the sound was beautiful. Besides having pieces of leather on my shirt when taking them off they are still rockin and fit great. Didnt need to charge them the entire trip from California to Africa and back. Well worth the price. Great sound, buttons easy to use, connects to 2 devices with ease.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AFA7U5BYN6KC2DRKQ4BFC63JQANA,True,9,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R1REYVNBG5AVBE,5.0 out of 5 stars There are no better BT headphones under $100,Carl Payne,5,"UPDATE: Added the 5th star. Read the review with edits at the end.Wow. I am rarely this blown away by consumer-grade peripherals, but I feel very compelled to write a glowing review of these headphones.I do a lot of audio work, and cans are ubiquitous. I have some wired Sennies that I love behind the mixer, a couple wired Audio Technicas that have stood the test of time in the broadcast studio, and a pair of nice Sony BT cans with ANC, so I will be comparing these Ankers to the Sony model WH-1000MX3.Without question, Anker has come further, faster, than a lot of peripheral manufacturers. The attention to detail in their products is exceptional, and downright attractive. The build quality is great, the packaging is great, the functionality is great, the ergonomics are great. My experience with their hubs is what leaned me toward their headphones.After a bad experience with in-ear phones on an airplane, I decided I really needed some over-the-ear headphones for flying, but I didn't want to carry around a $300 pair of cans that I only use a couple dozen times a year. I looked on Amazon, saw the reviews, read the single-star complaints, and plunked down a whopping $60 (SIXTY BUCKS?!?! Are you kidding?) figuring they couldn't sound that awful and would be perfect for the task.Let me assure you: these are the perfect headphones for flying.I like the idea that if they get lost or stolen, they're easily replaceable. I love how well they fit (with a caveat, below), and they look great. MOST of all, holy cow do they sound great!Pairing the first time was a little bit of a process, but that's to be expected the first time you play with a new toy. After that, I put on my go-to sound check song (""Sacrilege,"" by Mentallo and the Fixer), cranked the volume way up, and listened.I have no idea what the THD or frequency range on these are, but I don't think I care. The ""silent note"" at the 1:00 mark of that song came through so clearly, without even the slightest hiss or noise, that I was madly in love with them immediately. The dynamic range is exceptional, there was no need for me to play with the super-duper-bass-button-doodad, I just let it play.The highs are crisp without tinny tones, the lows are deep without rattling the 40mm drivers (I'd love a set like this with 50mm drivers), just a very clean, direct, simple, uncomplicated sound quality that rivals the AT 500's I have and is absolutely on-par with the Sonys.So I tested the ANR. I turned on the A/C in my office, reset Sacrilege, and played the beginning again. The A/C, as expected, kinda dampened the experience, but not any worse than the Sonys. I reset the song again, with the A/C on, and activated ANR (it's called ANC on the Sonys). THIS is where the two headphones differ dramatically.With Noise Cancellation on, the Ankers outperform the Sonys. Period. It's a night and day difference, so if this is why you're considering these headphones, waste no more time and go get yourself a pair.In terms of tonal quality, I put these at the top of the list of any wireless earphones anywhere. I mean it. They're better than ANY earbud type I've listened with, they're better than every other OTE without ANR/ANC, and they're as good as the Sonys, but with better ANR. They're better than any WIRED earbud, too, including the Sony IEMs I used to use back when everything had an 1/8"" jack.Sound is, as you would expect, not 'quite' as good as the higher-end wired ATs and Sennies. I don't think Anker would mind me saying that, because they're a completely different application. If you play MP3s and don't think they sound worse than lossless files, you wouldn't appreciate the higher-end phones, so go buy these right away. If you can't hear compression noise in your satellite radio, then you won't appreciate the compression of BlueTooth and you should go buy these right away.That's quite a lot of good stuff to say about a pair of headphones that cost less than a decent dinner.There are 3 reasons for the 4 star review.1. The ear pads are uncomfortable for my ears. Not VERY uncomfortable, but enough that I have to adjust the phones several times during a 3 hour flight. It might be that they're new and I just need to break them in. If that turns out to be true, I'll adjust the review up a star.2. The battery life isn't that great. To be fair, I only need about 12 hours of battery life and I'll just recharge them. However, the advertised battery life is estimated at 40 hours with ANR and 60 hours without. My experience is that with ANR I get about 22-24 hours, and without I get about 48. Now, I have not had these very long, so I've only timed my first recharges, so if it turns out the battery life goes up with proper use, I'll add the 5th star.3. They don't fold up as small as the Sonys or even my ATs. This one alone is not worth docking a whole star, but it's the only other complaint I have. Carry-on space is so limited, and there's a pocket in my bag that the Sonys fit in, and these don't (not by much though).Hope that helps you make a decision. I'm very happy with these, and I just might give them some airtime at sea level just for giggles.UPDATE January 2023: After using these headphones for a reasonable amount of time, I'm adding the 5th star. The earphone cushions did ""break in,"" which I'm not crazy about (if it breaks in, it will break out), but they did become more comfortable. Ordinary movement is sufficient to avoid the urge to move the head phones. On a 3 hour flight, they're perfectly fine. When they are new, the cushions are a bit stiff and I should have realized that, because my AT's needed their cushions replaced after umpteen years.Battery-wise, I am getting pretty close to advertised spec, but I have noticed that if you crank up the volume on your phone or player, then crank up the volume on the headphones, the battery life suffers dramatically. Play with it a bit, adjusting device volume and then headphone volume until you get good sound without noise.Finally, I'll tell you that I like these so much that I bought a BT card for my PC. These are pretty good for videoconferences, and they're nice to have while you run a buzzsaw or have screaming children next door and you just want to not be distracted. I'll still prefer my Sennies for mixing, and I still prefer my AT's for ordinary focused PC work, but these cans are exceptionally good. I cannot get over how good they are, affordable or not.Five stars. When they wear out, or break, or otherwise stop making me smile, I'll just go buy another set.","Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2022",AGD5QTRAY6ASQKN7OMV3PC6POPSQ,True,1628,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R1ABEIBHVJQEA4,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid choice in budget friendly headphones,Miranda,4,"They're perfect for what I'm using them for-- but definitely read first before buying, because the upgraded version may be what you're looking for.I am incredibly sensitive to headphones (as opposed to earbuds). My head is really sensitive to pressure, and even with light headsets I can start getting a migraine with constant pressure in one spot for too long. My ears also experience the same sensitivity-- they go numb/get tingly pain very easily with on-ear sets.I've been using my Airpod Pros as my go-tos for three years now, but I wanted over-ears for when I'm playing my keyboard piano-- it just gives a better atmospheric sound and nuance, in my opinion. So because of this, it was really important to me to get a pair that could be wired, on top of being bluetooth for versatility. I also prefer a wire option for AIRPLANES! If you ever want to watch an in-flight movie, you still need an aux cable these days. Surprisingly, it was difficult to find a model of headphones that still offer both options. It was a big reason I went with these.CHARGING/BATTERY:The first con is that these use micro USB to charge. Most updated tech is moving to USB-C, and I don't have any other devices that still use micro cables. When I travel with these, I need to remember to bring that designated cord. (Note, the Q20i model has USBC charging) On the other hand, the impressive battery life (60H with ANC off, 40 with it on) does help with that. I also like that it tells you verbally the battery level when you turn them on, so you get a heads up of what the charge is at. However, my apple devices also give me a battery percentage indicator for more accurate levels.EAR CUPS/NOISE CANCELLATION:The over-ear design is so much more comfortable than on-ear, and even helps enhance the active noise cancellation. A lot of external sound is filtered out even with ANC off because of how these cup around your ears snugly (but not too tightly!). My ears fit all the way inside comfortably. As I type this, I have cleaners in my home running a vacuum downstairs and I didn't even notice until I took the headphones off.COMFORT:When I first opened these up and put them on, I felt that the cups were putting slight pressure inward against my head, but after wearing them for ~5hr they seem to have already ""broken in"" and it's not noticeable anymore. As far as the top of the headset, I will say there's not a ton of cushion, but it's enough for these to feel okay for hours on my sensitive head.SIZING:They're not that heavy but they do press down a bit on my head because they're SLIGHTLY large on my head. I'm a 5'4"" woman, I'd say pretty average sized head?? lol - but these do feel a bit big on me. I don't think I would use them for working out or running, something as small as even just looking downward is enough to have them slightly slip. In general I do prefer working out with earbuds anyway just due to sweat, so that's not what I really bought these for anyway but thought I'd mention for any other petite women. Because of this, these are for sure going to be more for piano / computer / travel.BASS/SOUND:I feel like there was mixed reviews about the bass capabilities. Even with the BassUp feature off, I feel like the bass is great on these without distorting! I listen to Billie Eilish a lot, who is known for very bass-heavy music. Without BassUp, her songs sound well balanced (while still obviously bass-heavy). With BassUp on, you get that fuzzy feeling in your ears when the bass kicks in (but still no distortion). Speaking of Billie, she also utilizes stereo sound a lot (some sounds in left ear, some sounds in right) and it sounds great in these. Note that there is no transparency mode on these, but the Q20i model has that if it's a must for you.CONNECTIVITY:This was a big one for me, and probably the reason I am going to be returning these for the upgraded Q20i. I've been spoiled by my Airpods in terms of being able to switch between devices seamlessly (ipad/iphone/imac) without having to disconnect one device and re-pair the other. With this set, I have to go into my iPhone settings, disconnect, then pair with my computer and vice versa whenever I want to switch. It's a small annoyance but a convenience I really prefer.PRICE:I bought these on sale for $39.99 and I feel like that's a super fair price for the quality and buying from a reputable brand like Anker. I have several of their items, and they have great customer service. I'd much rather spend the extra $10-20 from the super off brands here on Amazon, just for the peace of mind that they stand by their products.","Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2024",AEX7BTHOU63GYGKQTAAC6HSPITZA,True,27,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R325WZ955J5MAO,4.0 out of 5 stars Super-Solid Bang-For-Your-Buck Pair of Headphones!,Jordan Pon,4,"Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------Sound Quality ---- 8/10These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORSI only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.Comfort ---- 10/10These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.Features ---- meh, not much to talk aboutReally the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.Aesthetics ---- 6/10Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.Connectivity ---- 6/10Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)","Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2020",AF57TFFL4RVTI3RUQXVEO24IMNTQ,True,442,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
RTYYTUIZAG0EK,5.0 out of 5 stars A Complete Review for the Average Joe,Kathy Tran,5,"This is a review comparing these headphones to the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II, and the Sony WH-1000XM4.Now I know what your thinking - how could you ever compare a cheapo $50 pair of headphones to the $300+ big boys in the noise cancelling world like Bose and Sony? Well these headphones are wireless, bluetooth, active noise cancelling, and promote themselves as comfortable with balanced sound, so in my book all three of these headphones are in the same league.The criteria is simple - I don't use lab equipment to measure, I'm not concerned about exact numbers, and I don't like falling for overblown hype or marketing nonsense. I use my own experience and non-technical knowledge to decide what I like best.The Soundcore Headphones:These headphones are comfortable. Maybe it's because of the 'cheaper' materials, or they are just genuinely made with comfort more in mind, but I can wear these all day with little discomfort. I wear glasses so a little annoyance is unavoidable, but these do a bang up job of not squishing my head, while still making a good seal around my ears to keep sound quality and noise cancelling from bleeding out. I have heard some having issues with durability, but my bose quietcomfort headphones wore out and cracked over time too. Replacements are plentiful and cheap, so it's a non issue for me.Comparability and Software:These are what headphones are meant to be. Simple buttons, simple pairing, no proprietary software that I have to download, no nonsense. Just pair and play. They also have a wired mode if I'm editing video or need them to not have any delay. Bluetooth will always have a bit of a delay, but it's nothing deal breaking, a few milliseconds at most. They do not have multidevice pairing, or absolutely massive bluetooth range (it still works perfectly for me going around my whole house no problem), and there is no EQ balancing, other than the Bass Boost.Overall SoundI'm not a pro audio engineer or audiophile. If it sounds good, it's good to me. I like these headphones in normal mode just fine. While the overall sound stage is fairly tight, and it can sometimes feel cramped with complex or intricate songs, I don't feel overwhelmed in any one way or another. The negative I have here is with their 'bass boost's mode. It's fair to say it does boost the bass, at the cost of literally everything else. It almost makes it sound like every other frequency is underwater when it's turned on. I keep it off 100% of the time - it's bad.Noise Cancelling:Here is the meat and potatoes of the review. I bought these for noise cancelling and noise cancelling alone. I was surprised - they are pretty good. My air conditioner dissolves away. Car noises and wind fade to imperceptible levels, and airplane sounds go completely away. The area it falls short in is human speech. I can still hear people without much difference. Not a killer for me, but slightly lacking in that regard. They also do not give me the headache compression feeling that some other noise cancelling can give me.Comparisons:Comfort - These surprisingly win. The Bose Quietcomforts are very close, but the headpeice is slightly tighter, leading to overall head pressure discomfort over time. The Sonys are even worse, with their high weight and size they can feel heavy over time, and make my ears warm after about 1 hour.Compatibility and Software - These are also the winners! Sony and Bose just cannot help themselves when it comes to collecting data and making their customers sign up for BS accounts. I'm not a super privacy nerd either, but when I have to take a photo of my ears (looking at you Sony!) Just to listen to music, I draw the line. The Quietcomforts are better, but the Bose app is just another step in between me and my music. Bose at least keeps the physical buttons, which I enjoy because touch controls are still a bit picky in 2020. Sony knows this well, as I fumbled and accidentally turned off my music or changed the volume or song accidentally about a dozen times on their headphones. Physical buttons are arguably uglier, but I value practicality over style in this regard. The Sonys also have multidevice pairing, and their bluetooth range is just stupid far, but I don't usually run a whole football field away from my phone at a time.Overall Sound - Sony comes first, followed by Bose, and then the Soundcores. The Sony headphones are very crisp, with a wide sense of space. I genuinely couldnt stop myself from smiling when I first put them on. They induce a sense of awe, and I loved their sound immensely. The Bose was slightly worse, and only a touch better than the Soundcores. Bose has cleaner bass, and a better sense of staging, especially with singing and high hat sounds. If I were to number them by sound the Sonys get a 96, the Bose a 85, and the Soundcores a 82.Noise Cancelling - Sony once again wins, but this time the Bose and Soundcores are tied. I genuinely could not tell the difference between the Bose and Soundcores when my eyes were closed as far as noise cancelling was concered. The Sonys I could though. They do a significant better job with human voices, especially crowds like in restaurants or outside. They are still audible, but pass the point where I cannot understand what people are saying - the Bose and Soundcores fail this test.The Overall:Comparing these headphones is an excercise in diminishing returns. For $50 the Soundcores cover about 90% of what the $300 Bose Quietcomforts offer, and about 85% of what the $350 Sony WH-1000XM4 offer. To me, that remaining 10% and 15% does not justify the additional $250 and $300 price tag. Now maybe you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have the best noise cancelling, or can't live without the absolute cream of the crop perfect soundscape - and in those instances the features may justify the cost. But chances are if you're debating on these headphones you are just the average Joe consumer like me, in which case these headphones will cover everything you need without bogging you down in unnecessary features or quality thay will go unnoticed in 99% of the population. I genuinely like these headphones, and will continue to lovingly give them daily abuse until they fail me. After all, I could buy and break FIVE of these before I reached the price of one pair of Sonys.TL:DR Give them a chance, you'll more than likely find their value apparent.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2020",AEBWJZ55L7XV3T354S22VM2GQK7Q,True,677,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R3TBHJ0I0G4WY0,5.0 out of 5 stars Best purchase for an overstimulated mom!,Alex G.,5,"Let me start by saying I wasn’t paid or given the product for free to say this….these are my genuine thoughts. I started looking for some over the ear headphones bc, as a mom to a small baby, I spend a lot of time awake at night on my phone trying to stay awake! I have regular Apple ear buds and never liked them bc they don’t stay in my ear at all. I chose this soundcore product bc it had the best reviews and was in my budget. I was immediately in love. I’m no expert in sound by no means but I do love music and love when things sound so clear and crisp. This delivers so well in that. The noise cancelling is my favorite part. As a mom to a very wild toddler, I can get overstimulated to the max. This makes it so that I can hear the screaming and laughing but it sounds like through a mile long tunnel, which is PERFECT. I’m sure other people would like more noise reduction but this is amazing for me to lessen all the noise but still be alert if needed. I suffer from migraines so the fit is a huge aspect to me. They seem very comfortable so far but using them for longer will surely tell. I wish there were more colors like a pale pink but I got the silver color and it is girly enough for me! It’s something I’d definitely wear outside the house at the gym or on a walk. They haven’t gone through a drop test yet which I’m sure they will bc again, wild toddler. But they seem to be durable and not super cheaply made. I do wish there was a hard case as all it came with was a rubber plastic bag. I’m sure I could find something cheap on Amazon though to fit.

R8FJIV29I1F67,"5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice headphones, works for sensitive heads too",T.M.,5,"Very pleasantly surprised, they are really nice.I have an extremely sensitive head and any pressure gives me headaches, so over ear headphones never work for me, but I saw a video recommending them for people like me, so gave it a try.Since getting them I wear them all the time, after several hours or on bad allergy days I do get a bit of a headache, but otherwise they are very comfortable, the squishy soft material is nice, and they're very light and gentle.Sound wise they sound great, and the mic seems to work good as well.For ANC, I originally thought it was supposed to mute outside sounds so I was disappointed, you can still hear well while wearing them, but it does soften noise.A few days ago the q30 was on sale and decided to try them for the better ANC (and the pink color lol), and there's very little difference between the two headphones, but I'm no sound aficionado.For the q30, the ANC and sound is customizable, the frame feels more sturdy, the ear cups are a tiny bit larger so slightly more comfortable on the ears, and it has USBC.Overall very nice, for some the q30 is definitely worth the extra $20, but for the average person who doesn't need the fancier sound tech, the q20 is just as good.I was leaning towards keeping the q30, but they're about 14grams heavier and my stupidly sensitive head can't wear them as long as the q20 T-T.I wish they'd make pink q20s...","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AHAUXVMB3X6IEVKLYM5QY4C4ODQA,True,0,Color: Silver,B0819LK85F

R2PRRSGGO8J48X,"5.0 out of 5 stars The Absolute BEST for Misophonia, Hyperacusis, and Sound/Sensory Sensitivity",sbonne,5,"I own so much sound defense equipment it's almost ridiculous. I have everything from Loop ear plugs to noise-canceling ear buds to sound machines to big speakers. I have a condition that makes certain sounds nd frequencies quite painful. Until now, every device I have tried had failed to provide complete relief. I wasn't expecting much of the Soundcore Q20 headphones, but if you struggle with sound sensitivity, you know the desperation for relief. My biggest battle has been my next door neighbor's lawn service, which uses equipment that measures over 90dB INSIDE my house with all the windows closed. I usually have to leave the house the moment I hear the truck pull up. Not anymore! I put the Soundcore Q20s to the test just this week, fully expecting that the lawn equipment (particularly the gas-powered leaf blowers) would make it through like it does all other devices I own, but it didn't! I was stunned! Even between songs, the noise cancellation kept my ears protected from the auditory assault I usually have to leave the house to escape. These are worth their weight in gold! I cannot recommend them enough. And in addition to being absolutely excellent at what they're designed to do, they provide great sound quality for music and they fit very comfortably. I don't usually like having things on or around my ears but these are quite tolerable. The cushioning feels nice, and there is more cushioning on the part that goes on top of your head. Oh, and the battery life? Phenomenal!! These charge quickly and the charge lasts for a very long time! Bottom line: whether you deal with hyperacusis, misophonia, sensory processing disorder, or just really value your peace and quiet, GET THESE. There are brands out there that cost a lot more and promise a better experience, but these are BY FAR superior to anything else I have ever tried. They will not disappoint! These would make a wonderful gift for the person in your life that struggles with sound or has autism or ADHD and needs relief from noise and external distractions. Literally a life-changing product. I'd give them more stars if I could!","Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2024",AH3JNQIYXWKIX5M3KYYWBSX6J5KA,True,6,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R3QAPNJ0V6TB8M,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise canceling without even turning on the noise canceling function!,Katie D.,4,"I have never really been a big fan of these massive headphones, but I was taking an extremely long flight and needed more than the 3 hour battery life my airpods offer. I would give these a 5 star overall review, but they are just a touch too big for my head, even at the smallest setting. I made it work for the trip but i do think it put a bit of pressure on my ears, despite some of the others reviews. If you have a normal or larger head, these will probably fit great! (I have to buy kids hats if that says anything about my tiny noggin')Overall, the battery life is incredible and these were perfect for using with the airplane screens (via 3mm jack) as well as my bluetooth on my phone. I personally think the silence they bring when you put them on even without turning on the noise canceling feature is fantastic. I really didn't have an need to turn on the feature for this particular trip. I have numerous other Anker products and I knew the sound quality should be good and it definitely was! I will say overall sound/bass sounds much better than my usual headphones.

R2D5N7MVCP2FAP,5.0 out of 5 stars Loud office? BUY THESE!,Katy Jordan,5,"Recently, a group of half a dozen younger, rather talkative, gentlemen were promoted to my department. I'm okay with chitchat at a nice reasonable level. But as the NBA Finals approached, their enthusiasm for daily conversations seemed to grow. I overheard rave reviews of various comedy and action films and television shows. I've listened to them flirt shamelessly with the one younger girl at their desk clump. I also overheard a particularly vivacious discussion about chewing gum that lasted approximately half an hour. It felt something akin to working in a locker room slash Dutch Bros. parking lot slash mall food court. Their volume grew. And grew. And I was afraid that one day I might be inclined to staple something to one of their heads if I heard one more thing about what the Mavericks can do to get more rebounds in the next game. My current earbuds were not working - I had to keep raising the volume, prolonged wearing made my ears itchy, and somehow I could still hear the boys! Desperate, I saw these headphones for a reasonable price and thought I'd take the chance.As soon as they were over my ears, it was like I'd stepped into an oasis. I could finally hear my own thoughts. Instant focus. I have become much more pleasant to be around. I no longer feel compelled to staple things to my coworkers heads. In fact, now I find these boys quite endearing and I hope all of their sports teams win.The noise cancelling is not perfect, but for the price it is amazing. I also have loop earplugs for concerts - if that helps as a reference point, these headphones cancel more noise than that. I don't have to turn the volume of my music up as high. They really are quite pleasant - that's the best word I can think of to describe them. They're adjustable, so they fit my head perfect, and perfectly cover my ears. I've heard other people say that other headphones start to feel heavy after a while and strain their necks - I have not felt that with these at all. They are comfortable, they look sleek, the battery seems to last forever, and I HIGHLY recommend them.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AH73MYPRDV2TK2KOUSR4BVVTMNCA,True,48,Color: Black,B0819LK85F

I was blown away by the ability to be noise canceling at the touch of a button. These came in today and I’ve been wearing them all day! I can’t say that I notice any difference between them and the AirMax. I own a vast amount of headphones, most that I’ve gotten off Amazon below $30. These were the first pair I spent more on, got them for $39.99 on sale from $59.99. I’m just a headphone junkie. These are fantastic! I’m obsessed and they are now my favorite pair. I will probably be purging some old ones soon. They’re all fairly decent for how much I paid for them, but these are absolutely my favorite!

R3L3SZ6RUZTBSX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding, but not without their flaws",Debbie Wiggins,4,"These headphones are a great value. They are extremely lightweight and sound quality is very good. Noise cancelling works well and is not far off from their more expensive counterparts. My main complaint with these is the size of the ear cups. They are quite small and just barely qualify as ""over ear"" headphones in my opinion. Part of the ear cup actually sat on top of my ear lobes. I found that this design along with the faux-leather material used made my ears overheat too quickly. That being said, I have issues with my ears getting hot with most headphones that I have tried, so take that with a grain of salt.It is important to mention that I could not get the noise cancelling feature to work when these were functioning off of the included cable. If you plan to use these wirelessly just for listening to music from your phone this likely isn't an issue, but I was considering using these for gaming so this did not fit my use case. In addition, I feel that these do not sound nearly as good with noise cancelling turned off. When noise cancelling is on, they sound amazing. With it off, however, they sound quite cheap and the clarity seems to decrease. I'm not sure what would cause this, but that is just my experience with them.I got these on sale for $40, so these are definitely a great value at that price point. If the negatives I mentioned are not deal breakers for you, I highly recommend picking these up when they are on sale.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AHSWFP7XSW3WSEK2XFIOZOMVMP2A,True,3,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R8A53BVTBUUTM,5.0 out of 5 stars Best ANC and Sound in it's price range!,Wendell Powell,5,"First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.Active Noise Cancellation:Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..Sound:I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..Quality:The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!Functionality:A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!Battery:The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!Packaging:The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..Overall:Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..","Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2020",AHAP5LT732R5D4AMGRRZYHQCNNJQ,True,489,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R3JEJFEWVA44XJ,4.0 out of 5 stars Nice sound quality but the fit takes some getting used to,Whit,4,"The controls on the headphones are really easy to use whether you want to pause whatever you’re listening to or adjust the volume of your headphones without taking them off to troubleshoot (my last pair from a different brand were so hard to pause, adjust volume, etc so this is a really great perk for my new headphones). I ordered the black pair and they look great. They’re easy to connect with my Bluetooth on my phone however the distance I can be away from my phone while I am connected isn’t that great. But if you keep your phone on or near you while you use them it isn’t an issue. The noise canceling feature works pretty well. I haven’t tried them in a super busy and loud setting yet but they do a good job dulling the sound of my lawn mower and leaf blower while I’m doing my yard work. The fit takes some getting used to. If I wear them too long my ears get sore and the top of my head where the strap sits starts to hurt too. But I haven’t worn over the ear headphones in a really long time so it may just be that my head and ears need time to get used to the new set up.

Placement is good and easy to use when on my head. Noise canceling works very well actually very quiet even without noise canceling on and works well for phone calls.

R3V6S1FQYWLWPU,"4.0 out of 5 stars An Honest, Unbiased Review **UPDATED**",Marc,4,"UPDATE, 2/29/20: Anker Customer Service has provided me an updated pair of the headphones for reevaluation. I have not experienced the popping issue at all with the new pair, so I am updating my rating to 4 stars. I still really enjoy the sound from these while ANC is on; strong, fun bass, and not at the expense of the mids and treble. Also, customer service also sent me replacement earpads in the event that they fail over time.Once again, I cannot say enough about how amazing Anker's customer service is. Many companies out there could learn a lot from how much they want their customers to be satisfied!UPDATE, 1/31/20: Unfortunately these are being returned, for 2 reasons:1) I'm getting the popping noise whenever I take off the headphones while playing in ANC mode (which is always). This simply cannot happen for headphones at any price point, much less $60.2) I can see already that the earpad leatherette covering is beginning to pull away from the housing. Since receiving the headphones, I have treated them with kid gloves, so in less than 2 weeks time I'm already beginning to see potential for long term build quality issues.So, as with other reviewers, bummed that these just don't live up to Anker quality. Leaving them at 2 stars as they are serviceable, but not a long term gamble I'm willing to take.ORIGINAL REVIEW, 1/25/20:We live in a world of excess. Headphones are a prime example of this. Not only are there many ""name brand"" manufacturers of headphones out there (Sony, Bose, Beats. et. al.), there are now endless ""no-name"" brands peddling junk. There are a handful of companies trying to find some middle ground, TaoTronics, Mpow, and, of course, Anker Soundcore. When it comes to headphones, at least for me, is value for price paid. Without a doubt, the more expensive headphones by Sony & Bose offer the best quality across the board, but they're not such a great value, at least for my needs. And to go super cheap with no name brands is a waste of time, as you'll make major sacrifices. Anker is trying to establish itself as the sweet spot for solid value without making too many sacrifices.Like other reviewers, I have used other Anker products, some good, some not so good. Their charging products are nothing short of spectacular. Their audio products, on the other hand, have always been hit or miss. I decided to take a chance on the Q20 headphones because A) they are a few generations in, so hopefully Anker has made improvements over time, and; B) they sit at a great price point (between $40-60 depending on timing). Not cheap, but not astronomical either.So after using them for a week, and making the decision not to return them (I have returned countless headphones), I wanted to share my first impressions. Maybe these will change over time as the build quality ages, or sound quality evolves with burn-in, but I wanted to try and help those on the fence with some honesty rather than the endless one line five star reviews.PROSComfort. While these are in no way portable, they are fairly light and not overly bulky. Most of the cheaper over-ears are simply too much like earmuffs in an attempt to maximize comfort and/or improve sound quality.Sound Quality. This one is both a pro and a con, so I will come back to this below. For the most part, I enjoy the sound quality on these. Admittedly, I like extra oomph in the bass, and these are definitely bass headphones.Battery Life. Gave them a full charge when I received them, and probably won't need to charge them again for likely...weeks. Since I only use them at work and occasionally around the house, I expect the battery to last quite a while.Value. So far, I feel like I am getting every cent out of my investment in these. Sure, they are not perfect (as you will see below), but for the price paid, they are meeting my expectations.CONSNoise Canceling. Yeah, Anker threw in noise canceling as that feature is hot right now. It's there, but it's mediocre. Would I trust it if I was a frequent traveler? No. That would be worth an investment in Bose or Sony. But at work and around the house, it's fine. I haven't encountered the popping issues other reviewers have experienced, so I will have to wait and see on that.Build Quality. This is where Anker was able to keep the price point low. These aren't the most solidly built, but they are passable so long as they are handled decently. A case would have mitigated this, but again, cost. The buttons are not the best, and over time I can tell that these will likely be the first things to fail.Sound Quality. Here is where I will contradict myself. There is a discernible difference in the bass level between noise canceling being off vs. on. When off, the cans really thump with bass, which is great when listening to pop, hip hop, or EDM. It's too overpowering for most rock songs, as it drowns out pretty much everything else. It's still listenable, but gets exhausting after awhile. With noise canceling on, it's better, but it seems like the sound quality degrades somewhat with the added layer of processing. Not a steep decline, but it does mean that I leave the noise cancellation on all the time, which will result in the battery dying quicker. Not a deal breaker.TL;DR: So overall, I recommend these headphones if you are looking for a solid pair of cans at a reasonable price, KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE BUYING. These are not going to give you superior performance on any feature, except for battery life. They are definitely acceptable for what you're paying for, and so long as the build quality holds up, should meet your needs for a couple of years. And if not, Anker has an 18-month warranty on defects, and their customer service is A+.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2020",AFWC3HQORHDCFQJN4P76FBRXOI7A,True,33,Color: Black,B0819LK85F
R3LYQ2WI5N0KRF,"5.0 out of 5 stars Good For Our TV Use, But Question the BT 5.3 Rating",Bob in Central Oregon,5,"We bought two of these to use for TV listening. We have a large difference in how much TV volume we need, and the easiest solution is two headphones with individual volume adjustments. I have a long history of success with Anker products so had no problem selecting these from the large assortment of BT headphones available on Amazon in this cost class. At the same time I bought a https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G8Q7NXZ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details transceiver for the TV, also with BT 5.3 low-latency claimed.The headphones paired easily with the transceiver. The sound quality is fine, and they link up quickly when powered on. The only disappointment is that there's a very noticeable lag in the audio, even with both components claiming the low-latency with BT 5.3. Unfortunately I have no other BT 5.3 pieces to substitute to isolate the cause of the lag. Since they will be used with the TV speaker turned off, the lag isn't as critical an issue as it might be if the TV speaker was still audible while wearing the headphones. Were I serious about testing/solving, I'd me much more inclined to swap he transceiver first.I did the first test while pairing with the transceiver plugged into my tablet, listening to a music stream. My vintage (read: old) ears liked the bass-boost function for the music, so one set of headphones has that selected. K has hearing loss in upper mid to treble range so bass boost would not benefit her, and in fact would be counterproductive. Hers is switched off. Nice to have that easy option. I have no other sound options selected at this early time.Yes I would buy them again. They are comfortable, fold nicely if I was planning to pack them for travel, certainly light weight on the head, and they will serve our needs nicely.","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2024",AGEBMVNXJABW4OKRV2MP7NS6FX6A,True,3,Color: Black,B0819LK85F

I was gonna buy them but then I saw these as the 2nd on the list at $49!!They mention the “active noise reduction” feature, so I figured, ya can’t go wrong with that price these days.

R5SDX41KD57A9,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones,Steven Lavey,5,"I've been using thease headphones for a while now and I feel like I've tested them enough to give a long term review. The headphones work great from day 1. They came partially charged. Disregarding the advice of plugging in and giving a full charge before use, used it all the way to see how long it would take to fully charge. First full charge was about 2 hours. Every full charge has been between 30 to 90 minutes. This is due to the quality of charger and cord used. In the instructions it says it has a quick charge mode where 5 minutes of charge gives 2 hours. I've found this is incorrect. 5 minutes of charge gives about 2.5 hours of use at minimum. I can usually get a full or nearly full charge at 45 minutes at average. Standby mode with headphones is the longest I've seen. I powered on the headphones and needed to do something, forgot about it until 2 days later. At 2 days standby with Noise cancelation on, the charge was about 20%. Noise cancelation works great. I've been using the headphones while doing woodworking. I doubt the headphones are OSHA approved but they work great with background noise. When I was listening to anything, I did not need to adjust the volume to hear anything. While I know this company as a very reliable company for USB cords and chargers, the headphones and earbuds they make are some of the best I've used and an excellent value. The only recommendation I would make is to change the charging port from micro USB to USB C, but I'm sure they've already corrected it with other models. There's not many companies out there that I'd ever consider myself a fan of, let alone recommend their products to close family members, this company is certainly one I do. The fit if the headphones are perfect, even with people who wear glasses.","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2024",AEQCO42XNU4WFC6TTDMJOKFJNB5A,True,11,Color: Blue,B0819LK85F
R3L3H4KCFQM4L,5.0 out of 5 stars These are excellent headphones!,Nkco Tigerman 🐅,5,"NEW REVIEW: I gotta give this 5 stars. I wasn't particularly fascinated by how low the sound was at first, especially with my music player mediums being at full volume... BUT THEN I eventually realized that the Noise Cancellation feature had something to do with that, so I turned it off. The EQ quality is spotless; the clarity and balance is top notch! The bass boost is very enjoyable, the product aesthetic is excellent, I love that it comes with a case for carrying and packing, the buttons are straightforward, and the headphones seem to fit well over small heads and big heads, Haha! Audiophile folks may indulge in the ANC technology, but I prefer it with that feature off because more power is needed to make the sonics more attractive to me. I prefer my headphones and earbuds to be loud enough for me to fully submerge myself in the music, so I can drown in the frequencies to catch the vibe of each song.I started with ""New Review"" because this is a modification of my prior review. I deleted my old review after discovering that turning off the ANC feature gives me the kind of loudness I enjoy when listening to music. It increased the performance of the headphones for me.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2024",AHFXESDXT5IPIGMGNBKGIFZUE2OA,True,0,Color: Black,B0819LK85F

They have been very durable, and I'm someone who is a little tougher on my things. They are comfy on my ears, and I have sensitive larger ears. While they are really nice quality for the price, I can still hear some sounds with the Noise Cancelling. I do have really good hearing, so that may be why. They are also slightly big on my head and have only fallen off during exercises with more head movements. I am a bit smaller, so I have taken that into account as well.

R1V2HAPIO5YL64,"4.0 out of 5 stars No noise cancelling, instead this is more like pump up the volume",William Yousef Fadel,4,"Normally, Anker products are really good, but these are dissapointing.If these where just headphones, they would be fine, they are comfortable, sound good (not audiophile good, but good enough), look kinda good (if a tad cluncky). But these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones. And they do not cancel noise at all.The only discernible effect when you enable noise cancelling is that the headphones pump up the volume of what you are listening, but, once you compensate for that, the external sound dampening you get is the same that you would get by just the cushions of the headphones.Mind you, I tested with a punny Nokia E71 playing TMBG's Call_connected_through_the_NSA.mp3 not some hollywood explosion fest. I do not want ""world around dissapears"" kinds of Noise Cancelling, but if these can't cancel a punny E71... Well, disappointed/dissapointingEdit #1:The reason I hold Anker in high regard, I because of their customer service, and this is no exception. I posted the review in about July 18, 2020, and today July 21, 2020 they contacted me. At least we know they still have top notch customer support, even during a pandemic.Nonetheless, their sugestions were not very usefull:«- Make sure the NC button is turned on(the NC indicator would turn green) when you want them to cancel noise outside.»Yes, I know very well how to press the button to get the green light, and also, a very nice lady voice says ""Noice Cancelling"", so yes, I was 110% (one hundred and ten percent) sure noice cancelling was active.«- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.»Well, we are under lockdown. When I am able to move out, I have more important thing to do than test noise cancelling headphones. Nonetheless, I'll try to do it and report back to Anker Customer Support, and to you guys. I'll also try to get the 10 min silent MP3s from Samir Mezrahito really test this out.Edit #2:I was ""finally"" able to actuate on Anker product support's sugestion and ""- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference."".For testing purposes I used the headphones in BlueThooth mode (to eliminate any electrical intereference noise). And used the song ""A a a a a a a a a Very good song"" by artist Samir Mezrahi, which, as you perhaps know, consists of almost 10 min of silence.I tested in various scenarios:1.) In my car, windows down.2.) In my car windows up.3.) Reving up my car to 2500rpm (in the parking lot).4.) In a bus stop (with buses comming in and out).5.) In the electric stairs of a ghostly empty shopping mall.6.) In a queue to pay for medicines (with ambient music and people talking at moderate volume).7.) Near the air extractor of my home kitchen.My results:1.) If wind blows in the headphones you actually get MUCH MORE noise with NC on than with NC off, so forget using the noise cancelling in a ferry boat, or in a bus with no Air conditioning, or in your car with windows/roof open, or in your bike.2.) The NC was able to diminish humming noises (like the engine), but not clacking noises, or noises derived from potholes and such.3.) The NC was very effective at mitiganting the reeving.4.) The engine noise from the buses was mitigated, but not the clacking or the chatter from the people waiting.5.) Again, the humm of the motor of the staris was mitigated, but not the clacking noises.6.) In the queue, the souund of the air conditioner or the store was somewhat mitigated by the NC, but not the ambient music or the chatter, and that actually ended up being worse, because it made more noticeable the music and chatter.7.) The NC was decent with the air extractor of my kitchen.But, in scenarios 5, 6 & 7, I noticed that the NC tends to cancel the low frequencies, but the high ones are not mitigated at all (currently at my 47yo, i can hear up to 15Khz, so for younger peiople is probably worse), so, actually enabling NC will make any high pitch noice more noticeable (i.e. the frequency responce of the NC is not flat).Finally, if one bought these headphones with NC because the noise made by rain, the AC fan or compressor, or some other noise like that was disturbing, it it will diminish it a little (but not much), but if one bought noise cancelling headphones because one wanted to evade the sound of coworkers talking, or kids playing in the garden or your SO watching TV in the other room, these headphones will do nothing more than what headphones with no NC (and therefore less expensive) would have.Edit #3 (and Final):Anker contacted me, and offered two options, return the item (as a very special consideration, since I am a few MONTHS completely outside of the return window), or get a refund for 20% of the cost, to get a more suitable Item. Since I order to the USoA and then have my Items forwarded to Venezuela, it is a hassle to return Items, so I opted for the refund, and it went smoothly.That is the good thing of going with Anker. The litmus test of a good company comes when things go wrong, and Anker has a stellar reputation for making things right. Upgraded the review from one star to 4, but not on the account of the product itself, but rahter, due to the excellent customer service.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2020",AF2NHPCDCZUYJXEC4KAFWB73FFRA,True,16,Color: Black,B0819LK85F

R14MJTIQHLNJV5,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good for the price,Jenna,4,"The noise cancelling isn’t the greatest, but for the price point, I wasn’t expecting much. They’re great for around the house, but on a plane or train, they don’t block out much. I ended up wearing foam ear plugs with these on top with sleep sounds playing, and I could still hear people around me and the engine humming.The sound quality is pretty good for music and podcasts. They’re lightweight enough for be comfortable for extended wear. And my favorite thing about them… the battery lasts forever (I use them several hours every day and only charge them once a week).I use them a lot for phone calls, and I’ve been told the microphone picks up a lot of background noise, so they’re not great if you’re trying to get other things done while talking to someone.

I've been using the Skullcandy brand for years and spent close to $100 on those and they are not comfortable after an hour or so. The headband weighs down on your head and the cushion makes them sit heavily on your head. Just not comfortable long term. These are light and comfortable with cushion ear cups that feel nice on your ears. As for what I'm not fond of, it seems like it takes a while to turn off when I push the power button. The noise canceling is okay and isn't up to some other higher end brands, but it's not bad. I love the extended playtime but wish the charging cord was longer and a USB C configuration, so I don't have to swap around cords for this and other devices. Still a great value and sounds good with EDM to acoustic music. Base levels are rich and treble doesn't sound tinny. Nice rich sound for a reasonable price. Would buy again.

The build quality is very good for the price (I bought it for 40 USD). My only complain is the active noise cancelling, which when turned on, lower the bass quality of the music (on Spotify at least). That's why I don't usually turn on the active noise cancelling, the good thing is that you probably are not going to need it, I can't hear people talking when playing music.One of the best things of this product is the battery.

The sound quality is decent but I wouldn't say outstanding by any means. Actually seem to get better sound through Bluetooth than wired which seems odd but hey you're buying BT phones anyways so... The noise cancellation is very weak, basically non-existent it seems to only filter out lows, like I can still hear my fan running in my window 15ft from me. Controls are simple and easy to use. My main gripe is that every time you move you can hear the various joints and whatnot creaking. Overall for like sitting watching a movie without disturbing your partner, grand, but I wouldn't use them as like day-to-day walking around cans if you really love your music.

Sure. They’re not Sony. They’re not Sennheiser. But if you’re like me and you just need some tunes to tune out the world when you’re commuting, walking, working, or eating, these do the job.Keep in mind, I treat my headphones like garbage. I lost the case/bag it came in so any time I don’t need it, it gets stuffed in my backpack or thrown somewhere for me to find later. After more than a year of this kind of use, it’s still sturdy and holding strong. I haven’t even put duct tape on it, which is more than what I can say about my previous pair.Will I get the same exact pair after this inevitably dies? …No. There are better options out there nowadays. But if you’re looking for a gift for a cranky high schooler or a new college admit…hell, I’d do anything for a pair of these my freshman year in college rather than the 5 other bad, dollar-store hand-me-downs I went through.Brief description about its functionality because you might need to keep this in mind: They’re very comfortable. I’ve fallen asleep in these before. However, they do have a tendency to slip off after continuous usage so I don’t really recommend this if you’re looking to run or jog or work out. They fold in, which is great for storage. They sit around my neck easily but I have weird sensory issues with that so I don’t usually rest them there. (It’s not uncomfortable but it’s also not comfortable.) And one final thing: lately, they’ve needed a LOT of time to charge. HOWEVER, even since I’ve gotten these headphones, they last an INCREDIBLE amount of time. I think my first few times using it I’ve literally had it on 5-7 hours a day for like, two weeks, and it still has charge on it. The battery life is god tier. Nowadays, it has been more like 4-6 hours for 1 1/2-2 weeks before I need to charge it. I’ve left these suckers on during classes and meetings and man, I’m always surprised by the voice telling me I’m still on a medium charge.Don’t take my word for it though.

For the price point on noise cancelling headphones, I went with these and let me tell you they are AMAZING! I know someone that paid twice as much for their noise cancelling headphones and I like these better! The noise cancelling is a God send, its helps me study and relax in peace. If you only have noise cancelling on and no other noise playing, you will still hear SOME noise, but it is much more muted and quiet. The sound quality on these far exceeds my expectations. If you need heavy, heavy bass, these might not be for you, but they do the job for me. The charge for me, lasts days, with the headphones being on for multiple hours per day. One downfall I want to mention is you cannot use these and charge them at the same time (unless maybe I'm dong something wrong), but that wasn't a huge deal for me anyway as I just let them charge overnight.

This isn't obvious in some of the reviews you will undoubtedly read while on the toilet. But it's Anker made. Who hasn't had great experience with Anker stuff? Your purchase history here on Amazon already has 14 Anker purchases. This won't be your first or your last Anker purchase. Aside from making you feel dumb with your friends because no one can agree how to pronounce the ""a"" in Anker, their products are solid performers at a good price.And that's how I'd describe these headphones - like a really nice Honda amongst Acura, Lexus, etc. Or a really good TV dinner where they get the cheese right. These Soundcores are not beautiful. They won't help you get the girl (or the guy. or the cute non-binary person you saw Wednesday). But they absolutely will make you feel glad you bought them.They are solid in the hand, if a little cheap feeling - but only next to high end headphones. They aren't flimsy by any stretch (do not try to stretch them). The plastic is thick and has a matte finish. The headband adjustment is solid - easy to move and stays in place once set. Comfort is excellent. The earphone cushions are buttery soft (and not all greasy like butter. That would be gross. Butter on your ears sucks.) The soft ear cushions make a great seal on your ears and don't hurt after wearing for hours, even with glasses.Some reviewes mention that these headphones can get a little sweaty. That does not mean the headphones themselves. These headphones produce almost zero perspiration themselves. But they may make your head/ears/ear area sweat. Because of the great seal made by the cushions, and due to the material being all natural vinyl or something, it can make things a little warm after an hour. But if you're sitting at the bus stop in this humid heat, your ears are gonna sweat. At least these headphones will protect your ears from the loud noises of the bus and the other people at the bus stop who won't stop talking about Sammy and why he took off. You don't need to hear that story again. Poor Sammy.The ANC (not the chain of movie theaters) is good. For headphones at this price, the noise cancelling is excellent. So I guess that means the noise cancelling is excellent. At this price. These aren't high end Bose, dum-dum. These will remove a lot of exterior sound like a droning fan, dogs barking, a baby crying, a spouse asking you to do something, a police officer telling you that you can't lie here, a drive through operator asking you want you want over and over and over.I haven't tried these on a plane yet. But I will. If I say I'll come back and update this review after using them on a plane, that would feel disengenuous, because we both know that's not going to happen. I feel like there is a modicum of trust and intimacy established at this point, and I don't want to harm that. So let's just agree to disagree, OK? I bet these will be great on a plane.Sound is really really good. I won't say excellent because you might like artificially enhanced Beats-like bass response, and if you do, trying to explain what ""subjective"" means will take too long. I'm kidding. If you really like a bunch of bass, that doesn't mean you are stupid. I don't think calling someone stupid is OK. You just have terrible taste and judgment and probably only give 40% effort at everything.These sound clear and crisp. Bass response is good without being overbearing. (for those who really like heavy bass, that has nothing to do with bears).Sound is great. Really great. Way better than those earbuds you've been using that start to feel uncomfortable after 45 minutes. Go on, take the plunge. I promise you will happy with your purchase and grateful to me and then we can be friends. You will love these headphones. Later, you will learn to love me.I can tell you are losing interest. I know that look. I'll wrap this up. Buy these headphones. You won't be disappointed. Get a cheap hard case. I found one on Amazon for around $9. Now you have noise cancelling g headphones that sound great, fit great, last a very long time on a single charge, and you'll invest way under $100 all in. You will be the envy of your friends. Or at least your friends' ears.","Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2020",AHIKDM2QQWVUXH6ZZKNTI52QJ2DA,True,42,Color: Black,B0819LK85F

As soon as the bass hits, the headphones start thumping and vibrating. My ears fit comfortably in the cups and I can hear the ANC working without music playing. It could be a bit more but it works. It is like I am in a different zone. The max volume could be higher. I preferred a USB-C port but will settle with this because of the purported 40-hour or 60-hour battery life. I recommend this to anyone on a budget who wants something that will last long.

I spent a good amount of time researching and the reviews convinced me to try these. I use them every day at the gym. The sound is comparable to Beats Studio, which is what I used for the last 3 years until they finally started to fall apart. I guess I’m rough on headphones between the sweat from the gym and careless handling. I consider these one of my better purchases. They always connect easily, the sound is very high quality, and the battery life is phenomenal. I spend 2 hours per day at the gym and I charge them once weekly, but they would last longer if I waited. I’ve been very happy with everything about these headphones. This is that rare time in life when buying the less expensive option actually works out well. If you’re comparing these to something in the $250 range, just get these. You’ll be glad you did.

RKHKXMSIWHYZW,"4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect, and better than the newer versions",Amazon Customer,4,"TL;DR -- these are the best noise canceling headphones, and they perform at or above the level of more expensive headphones. I tried the newer Q30 version and switched back to these Q20s due to the better performance.I bought these about a year ago, and I've loved them. The noise cancellation is excellent--my sister was showing me the noise cancellation on her new AirPods Max and it was comparable these Q20s. I get easily overwhelmed by lots of noise, so the noise canceling feature was the most important to me when selecting headphones. I use these to block out my husband watching TV, dogs barking, neighbors blasting music in my apartment building, people talking loudly on airplanes, etc. They are excellent, and I can wear them for several hours before my ears start to get a little sore. The battery life on the headphones is also really good. I'm not a huge audiophile so I can't really tell you if the sound quality is as good as more expensive headphones, but I have no complaints about the sound when I'm listening to music.The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that I can only connect to one device at a time. If I'm using them for my laptop and I get a call on my phone, I can't take the call on my headset without manually switching the bluetooth connection over. This bothered me enough to try the newer Q30 headphones, which can connect to two devices simultaneously and also have a little feature that switches from noise cancellation mode to transparency mode when you tap the right earphone. After a couple weeks of trying them out, I am returning the Q30s and going back to my Q20s. The newer headphones had less effective noise cancellation, and I would occasionally get a sharp piercing sound in my ear through the headphones that was a little painful. Some of this could be the shape of my ears or whatever, but I found the Q20s to be more comfortable with better noise cancellation, and a much better price point. I can live with the minor inconvenience of the single bluetooth connection in exchange for better noise cancelation.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2024",AEYVMYSZVTBHXNPGVOTMJ5G3JRTQ,True,88,Color: Blue,B0819LK85F

I'm so amazed at the sound and quality from them.I haven't even spoke about the phone call quality. My car is modified with a loud exhaust and stiff motor mounts which makes you feel the vibrations from the motor and makes the car loud inside the cab.

R1FHD65JDCCMGU,5.0 out of 5 stars O.M.G. (for the price),Giblet Gravey,5,"Just got these, but had to say they really sound AWESOME! These provide the best sound I've ever heard via streaming Apple music, and that is compared with my Audio-Technica hard-wired M50s and my Beats Studio Buds (and some cheaper headphones/ear-buds). I'm also comparing this with a good $200 DAC and high-end Bluetooth loudspeakers (or again the M50s).With default settings (ANC on, no EQ) there was a noise-floor and too much bass. The ANC defaults to on, so the first thing I do is turn that OFF (...every time I turn-on the headphones...). I have no use for ANC, and find any ANC does ""funny things"" to my ears, even ignoring the noise-floor.Next, I'm using Apple music, lossless, so my source material is good. Then, I use Boom 3D and my Android phone. I use Boom 3D pretty much everywhere, since I often like compression for those podcasts or movies with volume ""all over the place"", but that's just Windows. Here, with these headphones on Android, Boom 3D is limited to the basic functions (EQ, and a bit of DSP effects). Anyway, after using Boom 3D's EQ to dial-down the bass (BTW, the bass-boost on the headphones is INSANE: not for me, and BTW I'm a bass-player), I was SHOCKED how good these headphones sounded!S H O C K E D !Hey, they are still $60 headphones (not the strongest build-quality, ANC has to be turned-off every time), but for the price (...and I got them on sale...), I am VERY happy.I realize not everyone uses Boom 3D (worth a try, BTW), but I do suggest having some EQ handy to dial-down the bass, or otherwise tune these to your preferences. The mids and highs are there, but these are definitely bass-heavy by default.","Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2024",AHUBR44TJTI4UC2DE6ZLDA4C7WIA,True,0,Color: Black,B0819LK85F

So far when I used them for a couple hours it hasn’t happened tho be aware I think the most amount I used them have been 4 hours maybe. I used them when I’m cooking or cleaning too since the duration of the battery is so long which is a plus. For music and audiobooks are great. If you want something cheaper I’ll go for this ones.

It's a no brainer on buying these. I'm going to order 3 more for my kids. They tried them on and they LOVE them. They always lose the little expensive earbuds. Can't lose these. The only thing I would wish better would be... the placement of buttons. When you fold them up, the power button on the left ear touches the right ear and turns on every time! If you don't notice this, it will be constantly on. Even so, it really won't matter because they must have alien technology because the battery life on these mamajammaz are absolutely insane.

I am happy with this purchase.However, there are two things that I don't like about this headphone that could've been very very easy to fix:The off button is moody - almost every time, i have to double check that it actually turned off the headphones, because many times, pressing & holding it for 3 seconds (like the manual says) does absolutely nothing.Second, the USB port is USB Micro, rather than USB C. This is the only new device I bought in the last few years that uses USB Micro, and whenever I need to charge it I need to scramble for my one usb mini cable. While USB C I have everywhere, since that's the standard.Sound-wise, the headphones deliver pleasantly colored sound - these are not studio monitors, they prettify what you hear, and for me that's a good thing. The noise cancellation is soft, if that's the most important feature for you, look elsewhere. For me it's ok, reduces ambient noise but doesn't feel like a vacuum.Overall, 3 stars generally and 1 additional star for the great price.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AHLUTP5Z23FAXPIWTWVMJF7ZJZEA,True,10,Color: Black,B0819LK85F

R3RD7IRXSIB4D,4.0 out of 5 stars Good deal. Pleasantly surprised with the sound quality!,Joe DeMille,4,"Got this on sale around $40 about two weeks ago. Way better than other headphones I have tried in the same price range $40-60. This is my third set of Soundcore products. I have been pretty happy with each of them, which is why I was comfortable going a bit beyond my initial budget.The noise canceling works great and has the option of being turned off. It's amazing to feel the sense of silence that the active noise canceling creates. Great for sensory processing, even when using this feature without music or a movie.The on/off/connected sounds and voice are pleasant and the volume for these can be adjusted independent of the headset volume. No loud annoying voice breaking my ear drum to let me know it's on, or the battery is low.Sound is crisp and clear with good mid tones and bass. I have only used these for watching movies so far but they seem to have a good range and I can actually hear background noises in films that I hadn't been able to pick up on before. The listening experience is pleasant and encompassing.I took one phone call so far and I could hear the other person well. They seemed to hear me fine. I did not ask for their feedback so I'm unsure of the sound quality in that regard.The control buttons are easy to understand and use and the headset itself is adjustable and comfortable. I do have a small head so every full headset like this is always just a fraction too large, but with this set it doesn't hurt my head or ears. I have piercings and the soft ear cups do not irritate them.Only downside is that the charging port is for a micro-usb, but that is just a minor inconvenience.So far the charge lasts me a few days with some pretty heavy use, including leaving them on when I pause a show and get caught up doing something else.Easy to connect via Bluetooth. I have not tried these line-in yet.Good purchase, even at normal price. I usually put a lot of effort researching different products to find affordable items that are still good quality. I'm glad I went with this headset as it surpassed my expectations.","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2023",AGKIKMUDFTERLAHVMUUZUMBD3JNQ,True,2,Color: Black,B0819LK85F

My main gripe is that the instruction manual that came with it is printed in a microscopic typeface in LIGHT BLUE ink, rendering it impossible to read without a magnifying glass and a strong light. I found a more readable version on the product's website, but it was confusingly written. I managed to figure it out finally, but what's wrong with having a simple diagram that points to and identifies each of the three buttons on the headphones. It's also difficult to see the black on black buttons. Letters and markings are etched or pressed into the plastic. How hard would it be to apply a bit of white or red paint so that the functions are easier to see? I even need a flashlight to determine which side is L and which is R. Yeah, I'm a grumpy old man with poor eyesight.On the plus side: the noise canceling feature works well and they sound good and they were way cheap compared to Bose for example.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2024",AGMEYNEPX6CZRP2AH6OIOU2A7WLA,True,0,Color: Black,B0819LK85F

R32JVWLNA6ETSJ,4.0 out of 5 stars Unbeatable bang-for-buck,JK,4,"I grabbed these while on a trip; I have an old pair of Sony XM3 noise cancelling headphones I normally use on the plane, but since my wife was using them for her own trip, it left me needing something for the 5 hour flight. Grabbed these since the price was right and I could get them from Amazon overnight.I wasn't expecting them to be as good as my Sonys, but they did surprise me, ESPECIALLY at their price point. These things punch well above their price.-Noise Cancelling: not as good as the XM3s, but enough to dull the engine roar and passenger chatter, which was all I was expecting. 4 stars here, as I'm not sure you'd get a better ANC experience without spending 3x as much.-Sound Quality: very impressed, for the price. A little muddy in the mids/highs, but these aren't audiophile headphones. Bass was fantastic (regardless of price).-Comfort/Build: on the cheap side (but they're under $50, so well within expectations). 5 hours on the plane with no issues, plenty of battery life remaining. I wear a 7 5/8 hat, so I struggle finding headphones that don't squeeze my melon - these were completely fine.If you have $50 and need some decent BT headphones, get these. Don't buy them specifically for the ANC, but it's a nice bonus to have at this price point. Fantastic general-use/flight headphones, and I'll be keeping them as spares for flights.","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2024",AHP7OAQSTTGHTRO6TZU7WVTAFB4A,True,2,Color: Black,B0819LK85F

I was frying chicken while listening to them and when I took them off for a second I was surprised how loud the grease was even though I was standing right in front of it the whole time. Tbh I don't really notice a big difference between the noise cancellation being on and off.

R1M1ZIK6WZ8AIK,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Low cost AirPods Max alternative! A classic revisited!,Mahajo,5,"My earliest forays into a More expensive headphone was with the Beats Brand and the wired Beats Pro headphones. Then I graduated to the wireless Beats Studios, as well as the Executive headphones and those were my headphones for years. I don’t recall the noise cancelling being anything at all and of course there was no such thing as a transparency mode back then, but at the time I loved the look, the colors (especially metallic gold of the Beats Studios) and enjoyed the heavy bass sound they provided. As I grew more sophisticated and appreciated more sound quality, I moved on to other headphones (plus my last pair of Beats Studio the hinge broke on one side). I had tried the Beats Solo Pros and wanted to love them but they were, though improved, still an on-ear headphone and too uncomfortable for me. I had hoped then that an update for the Studios to Studio Pros was imminent but turned out it would be awhile before this did come to pass but I knew once it did I would have to buy them and try them out eventually. It didn’t take long as I saw they went on sale for $100 off only a month after release and I jumped on that deal! I am pleasantly impressed for the most part. They do a lot of the same things as the AirPods Max, if not as well. Sound quality is really good and has a more neutral sound than previous Beats Studios did. The Dolby Atmos with head tracking is fun. They are a little bright sounding and I sometimes have to either turn down the volume or use the eq on the iPhone Music App to lower the treble, or turn off the Spatial Stereo feature in the control center, (long press on the volume slider) but overall I find the sound pleasant and lively. There are no wear sensors, but I love the old school B buttons for pausing, volume and skipping and rewinding tracks very easy and intuitive after using Beats Studios for years so I don’t really miss it that much frankly. They are fairly comfortable, the cushioning on the ear pads and headband are plush but they do have a strong clamping force which might bother some but doesn’t bother me overly much, and I am fan of how stable they feel on my head. Noise canceling is quite good but as is expected not at AirPods Max level. I’ve always loved the 5 LED lights on the bottoms of the right ear cup which will show you the battery level when pressed. A double press of this button will switch between ANC and Transparency. Long press for Bluetooth pairing. No auto-switching between devices but once connected to a device in your iCloud, they automatically show up in other devices in the cloud and a press within the Bluetooth’s settings will switch it to the other device quickly and easily. The headphones will announce messages and you have the ability to use “Hey, Siri’ but I’ve noticed sometimes audio will stop with an announcement or Siri activation and may not continue playing music on its own, but a simple press of the “B” button will start play again. On the AirPods Max audio will reduce significantly but not stop, but with these the sound stops abruptly which can be jarring at first when the announcement is made. Of course you can turn off announcements in the control center if you want to avoid the interruption altogether. Build quality is plastic but still solid with metal sliders that have a jarring but somehow pleasing click as you slide them in or out. They are also very light, certainly lighter than the AirPods Max (which I also own). Also the case is nice with a spot for cables and even another pouch inside on the other side if you need it, but can’t really imagine adding much as with the headphones in, there really isn’t a lot of room. If you can get these on sale especially I would recommend then as a less pricey alternative to the more expensive headphones like the AirPods Max. I’m a fan of the sandstone color, I hear the dark colors, especially black, are finger smear magnets. These are a little bit like that, but with the light color it is much less of an issue. These are a classic revisited and I will always have a soft spot for the Beats Studio (now pros) headphones! I forgot to mention that you can use the usb c cable for lossless audio from your computer or iPad, which is awesome, although i have yet to try that out as I am all about wireless functionality, I don’t like being tied down to wires! Still great option, and one the AirPods Max cannot do (yet anyway). These are a great option for those not willing or able to spend more and still great a great headphone!","Reviewed in the United States September 11, 2023",AGUIQ5S5JSDEN4XKQGG5JPZZQNHQ,True,342,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22
R1MZVYL3ULXVYC,"5.0 out of 5 stars The King is back, for a niche audience",Apple nerd,5,"I loved my Beats Solo headphones as a teenager. I’m talking monster cable beats. Nothing was cooler, the bass was thundering, and while it didn’t sound great, it sounded so much better than the iPod in ears or my dad’s old crappy walkman on-ears I was used to. I listen to mostly electronic music, bass/dubstep, house & techno, all of that with some hip/hop and pop sprinkled in as well. I also love movies.As an adult at home, I have my beyerdynamic dt 770 pros for mixing and editing with. I have a pair of AirPods Pro 2s for travel and day to day usage. Recently, I have started to work from home a lot more in meetings, and there has been a lot of construction outside my window, and I hate having things stuck in my ears for hours on end so I was in the market for a pair of noise canceling over ear headphones.My partner has a pair of AirPods Max, I found the sound to be really great, detailed with good sound stage and flat great for voice but clinical and safe in all respects and lacking the bass I was looking for. Even with the top-of-the-pack anc and apple integration features I was used to on my in-ears I never could swallow the price. Also they were comfortable, but so heavy and not suited for long periods of wear. And the case was weird.So I tried the bereydynamic lagoon ANCs. They were garbage. Impossible to use the controls and pair with devices, sounded really good but not as good as I would expect from this brand, and the issues go on and on. They did have good bass, but the anc barely worked. I liked them at a lot at first, but they fell apart so quickly.Then I saw that apple had brand new beats headphones, and were 30% off on Amazon. I had to try them, the nostalgia hit hard and I’m so happy they didn’t change the iconic design from the studio 2s which I also liked as a replacement for my solos. I. Am. Floored. Super lightweight yet feel very solid and no creaking, apple integration features (i consider no auto switching to be a plus tbh, but icloud pairing is a must. Works very well with Apple TV), but the sound! Is so FUN. It’s like I’m in a concert hall with huge racks of speakers and towers of subwoofers. So much better than my old beats, by a landslide. Great instrument separation, and decent soundstage, sounds less like a wall of sound like my pro 2s do but not as wide and spatial as the max. A little bright for my taste, but never enough to cause fatigue. None of them come close to the 770s of course - would I recommend these for classical? Or acoustic? Never. Or for any type actual professional work? No. But if you like electronic, you will have so much fun enjoying music with these. The ANC and transparency is very very good, identical to my AirPods Pro, I would argue maybe even better than the max in some situations. The mic quality is good, not as good as my AirPods but good enough for work calls. I also love watching movies, and having multi-channel support like my pro 2s is epic. I absolutely love these - and am so happy I got them!","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2023",AEUHSKBV2ADJTTXVB55RN7UQQZTA,True,359,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22
R2TKWVR4L10Q0W,5.0 out of 5 stars Very good and an honest review,Jeffrey K.,5,"I bought my beats studio pros (blue) as my old Bose Headphones died. Bluetooth linked perfectly to my devices. There is some audio lag (latency) if watching video (similar to all other audio devices I've used). I personally love that it comes with a 3.5mm audio cord. I used that to watch video on my computer. It saves battery and with the cord there is no latency. Sometimes it is just nice to have a corded headphone. Without the cord, the bluetooth range is pretty good.Sound quality is very good and I am most impressed with its ability to do DOLBY ATMOS. Make sure the content you are listening to is formatted for ATMOS and that your phone/device has atmos turned on. It makes a big difference. Bass sounds good and deep but maybe a little less than expected for Beats. Volume turned up loud did not make crackling noises or become distorted. Battery lasts a decent amount and nice to recharge by USB (goodbye batteries!). Noise cancelling is pretty good too and with audio playing it gets rid of any outside noises.Some people complained about the comfort and their ears hurting. I have not experienced this. The ear pads are pretty soft and your ear (mine at least) fits INSIDE the padding verses ON my ear. I can wear for hours and have no issues.Overall a well made product that sounds great for $200 (Deal Price).

R3RSUGFYRCGKOF,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound, Good Quality.",Spazzola,5,"Well, after having lost one of my AirPods (gen3) and not being able to justify purchasing a replacement left pod for $90, I started doing research.I came across these beats studio pros and looked at their stats. 40 hours of play time? Probably the most enticing thing about them to me. Then came the active noise cancellation, and spatialized audio. ANC intrigued me. I wanted it to be better than the AirPods at cutting out sound. While I was looking into these I happened to be doing it during Black Friday deals. Which meant I thought they were $170, which was the price of brand new AirPods. Then I saw their original price of $350. Which enticed me even more in a way, thinking of the price tag fallacy, higher price must mean quality. I mulled this over and over and eventually ended up missing the half off sale. Then I knew I wanted these babies. I watched and waited for a sale to come up again. I was not willing to pay $350 for wireless headphones, as I am not willing to pay $350 on just about anything, but thats just me. For me, $179 is splurging significantly. I caught another sale. I bought them and hoped for the best.I will have to be honest in saying I was hesitant to stray from AirPods and move over to headphones. The less I have on me the better, so having something sit in my ear rather than over my head appeals to me. But having my device constantly slip out of my ear or feel unsecured was not enjoyable. That’s how I lost my left AirPod in the first place. These headphones feel sturdy for me. I was pleasantly surprised. Although I still did not particularly care for a bulkier heavier device, I did appreciate their securedness. They do eventually make my ears sore but I usually just adjust them. I will not count this against them because every pair of headphones I have ever owned eventually made my ears hurt or gave me a headache. Im sensitive what can I say? The padding on the top band that goes over your head was a nice touch.The ANC is powerful. I loved being immersed in my music. I have no complaints really.Spatial Audio… I personally could care less about it, so I don’t have much to say about it. I just don’t use it as a personal choice, not saying it isn’t good.The sound quality seems adequate to me.The volume is pretty great, I never have to have it all the way up to get clear sounding audio or to feel like I can actually hear something. Which with my AirPods was a constant problem.The mic on these, I am thoroughly impressed with. Compared to my AirPods, its like award winning lol. People on calls usually can’t tell I am using a headset at all.I’m not sure how long it truly takes to charge them, as I haven’t charged them from dead to full yet. I imagine from the little bit of charging I did do when they first arrived they will take a little bit, but to me it’s worth it.Overall, I feel my money was well spent on a good product. I got a better bang for my buck with these beats than I did with my airpods. The compactness of AirPods are nice, and I like a compact item so having a larger device is something to get used to but I still think it’s worth it.","Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024",AFGMDHUXSF76BWEEVF5IAL7E6NKQ,True,62,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

The headset rests on my big head with no issue and the pressure from wearing them isn't uncomfortable.I like the Transparency mode, especially when travelling, so I can hear the crew announcements easily.I also like that it comes with a 1/8"" audio male-to-male cable for use on airlines with traditional audio jacks.And - controlling the headsets using my iPhone is a nice feature.CONS: The perceived air pressure on the eardrums from full noise cancellation is STRONG. Almost uncomfortably so, and you'll see similar comments from others here in the Reviews section. It takes getting used to. I almost sent these back, but in the end, the pros outweighed this issue. You may find it too much for you.Expensive: these are pricey, and if you're going to drop this much coin, you should at least try the Bose QuietComfort cans first. While they'll lack the iPhone integration, they may end up being more comfortable for you.Bass: ummm - where IS the bass? These are Beats, right? Studio Pro edition? I'm not really getting the lower frequencies here. Maybe I missed a step during setup. The sound quality is good but I thought a lot of Beats' reputation was based on the bass.All in all, I mostly don't regret my decision. But definitely try more than one model before you decide for sure.","Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2024",AE66YM6J42DY23ARCZVC74NSZSAQ,True,88,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22
RES90N3UIN1OY,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth it,Erica 🌞,5,"I was looking for heavier headphones to wear while working out. These work great, I can bend over and they won’t slip off. They were pricey but worth it in my opinion. Sound quality is top tier, battery lasts a few days if using a few hours a day. They do suction to your ears a bit so my ears are tender after wearing them for over two hours but it’s still mostly comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AGRW3MRCTLBBRFXD5UCXWMIJKMEQ,True,4,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22
R3DRKG1RCX4FWA,5.0 out of 5 stars Attractive - effective,Art W.,5,"I was wary about a rapper recommending headphones to me, a melodic musician. I bought on sale with the fear I'd have to return them. Surprisingly, they are excellent; the sound, including bass response is rich and vibrant without the curse of booming bass. I wear hearing aids behind my ears and the cups fit over them very nicely, boosting the sound as needed with earpiece controls. They are also very attractive and fold into the included case for carrying. To nitpick: the ear cups could be a bit larger but suffice. An excellent product!","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AGOVEJJB6MHSPSQU6YHLLWXNB32Q,True,0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22
RDHOFA7MKRYPL,5.0 out of 5 stars THEY DESERVE NEGATIVE STARS,Warning Please Read!!!,5,"Please read this review if you are thinking of buying g these headphones!!!!! They are on sale for a reason, and it’s not because they are good or even meh. I compared them to my old Studio 2’s from 2013 (11 years old) and they are horribly different.I had high hopes for beats since I use the fit pros, and boy was I disappointed. More than disappointed I was let down. I still have my Beats Studio 2’s from 2013 the silver titanium color way, and I’ve loved every minute of having them because of the loudness and club-like thump they have to them. They are relatable to one of the cars that passes by you with the windows shaking because the bass is so hard. Especially after 11 years that they still work and function the same as they did when I bought them minus a few cosmetic defects. So with high hopes and promises that these Beats Studio Pros would be just as great, I ordered them and got the maroon color because I liked the color. I should have known that if the colors have to be nice to make up for how awful the headphones were I wouldn’t have even glanced at these.These headphones are great if you want to listen to something and you have a hearing aid so it doesn’t hurt your ears. The sound is not nearly as loud as the 2013 model and being 11 years old I was very surprised. Apple has ruined the name Beats and all of their headphones minus the earbuds since all earbuds are relatively the same(I have the fit pros now and they are great) but the fact that brand new headphones can’t outperform 11 year old ones is just sad. Disappointing. A let down. I was thinking the new model would be the same if not better than the old ones I have since the treble and mids may have changed in the time I’ve had the headphones but I was so wrong. They sound almost the exact same with one major difference. The bass. The one thing that I feel most people loved about Beats was the bass and how it would sound like you just walked into a club when you wear them. I was utterly distraught. The studio pros on Bluetooth were so bass negative I thought I didn’t have the volume all the way up. Once I realized I did I thought maybe it was just the fact I wasn’t using one of the ‘3 specialized audio modes’ that the new model has. Even there I was let down. I played different songs, tried different audio settings on my phone like bass boosted and acoustic and rock but none of them helped the headphones. So after all the thoughts that went flooding through my head, one thing stuck out. Apple had ruined the classic Beats headphones. Don’t get me wrong the sound of the treble and mids was fine but still nothing compared to an 11 year old model. I was highly disappointed overall and would not recommend these to anyone even if they have an unlimited budget. It is just not worth the letdown.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2024",AFDOLKER2GHNCK53GDAR2YNQPMVQ,True,74,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22
R2UXJLAZR33T40,4.0 out of 5 stars Same Headphones for same price at Apple; Purchase AppleCare Plus for $29 from Apple,Amazon Customer,4,"I love my new Beats. I gave it four stars because I keep getting disconnected from my phone. I will update the rating if I figure out why and can correct the dropped calls. I will contact Apple support when I get a chance.This review is being written regarding AppleCare Plus. Huge suggestion: Buy AppleCare Plus directly from Apple for $29. Save yourself the hassle! Also, I recommend checking the price. I just purchase the Beats Studio Pro from Amazon for $179. Regular price was $349. Apple is also selling them for $179 as today, 6/16/24. I'm writing this long review I. Case it helps in regards to purchasing protection. I wanted to understand why AppleCare Plus was rate 4 stars instead of 5. I've had it and have it for several products and have always been highly satisfied. After reading nearly all of the 1-star reviews, the same message stood out- DO NOT PURCHASE APPLECARE PLUS FROM AMAZON. I decided to forgo reading the 5-star messages from approximately 64% of the customers, and just heed the message to purchase directly from Apple. Below is my experience in doing so. Again, to be fair, I cannot review the process for purchasing this plan through Amazon because I did not do so -I just wanted to avoid any hassle.I spoke with 3 different people from Apple's support team- one person via chat and two people on a phone call. All three people were extremely helpful, friendly, and made sure they did everything to help. It took nearly 45 minutes to purchase because the problem was my purchase date showed up as April 15, 2024 versus the true purchase date June 14th, 2024. The chat agency tried to change the date and it took down. Despite her efforts she was unable to change the date on her end so arrange to have someone call. A support person called, I missed the first call somehow,contacted the old chat message asking for a new call time. The support agent happened to called back anyways and the chat agent had also arranged a new call. So helpful on both ends. After speaking with the support person, he had to get additional help because again, the purchase date was not showing up. The last young lady I spoke to was able to work magic on her end and set it up where I was finally able to purchase AppleCare Plus for $29. I am highly satisfied with the support I received from Apple and I have peace of mind knowing my headphones are protected for 2 years! Next time, I will purchase products directly from Apple if the price is pretty much the same. This way, I can easily add AppleCare Plus! Had I checked before hand, I would have seen that Apple was offering the headphones for the exact same price as Amazon.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AEL3YFH2XJPGWP5J3F4I2KFB5KCA,True,0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22
R2XAKEZ1YV6ZXY,5.0 out of 5 stars Mom necessity,AlyssaBentley,5,"If you are a stay at home, mom like I am you definitely need these. I use these every single day without fail. Normally, I would not spend the money on these because they are expensive, but my husband bought these for me as a gift and they are the greatest gift ever. Use these normally when I go to the gym to tune out to any clinking weights and just so I can focus on my music or podcast. But the game changer is when I use these for daily chores while my kids are napping. I can still listen to music that I want, and listen to a podcast WHILE I am vacuuming and I don’t miss a thing. These are also great when my husband gets home from work and I’m trying to put dinner together together. I put these on and I can tune out the noise and the kids so I don’t go insane. The noise canceling on these is perfect. These are definitely worth the money in my opinion and also a great Mother’s Day gift or birthday gift for an overstimulated mom.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH3VYDJ3HII3MIMZOXN6HWTFIIZA,True,0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22
R3REKPIFS6TC75,4.0 out of 5 stars Review And Comparison To The Sennheiser Momentum 4,vladislav grutsenko,4,"Highs: Beats > Sennheiser.High frequencies are good in both headphones, but Sennheiser has them more emphasized. Sometimes it feels like if you crank them slightly higher you're gona hear sibilants. It's on the edge and this is not the most pleasant edge to me. However, the sound is accurate and somewhat distinctive in the upper-frequency range for the Sennheiser. As for the Beats, highs are as detailed as on the Sennheiser (if not more) but not overemphasized.Mids: Beats > Sennheiser.Sennheisers have a so-called v-shaped sound profile so it feels like Beats have way more mids. It might be even too much at first, but you get used to it. Beats are more detailed and fast. Sennheiser feels muddy in comparison (but still very precise and detailed compared to Sony and Bose). I think it's partially because of overemphasized bass that brings distortion into the mid range. You start hearing things that were not originally intended to be there by artists. Because of this, Sennheiser sounds more ""musical"", it fills the voids between the instruments and produces an overall ""dense"" sound. And the Beats have more reference sound. For many instrumental tracks (rock, metal) Beats might sound boring and hollow. I can't blame the headphones because such music is usually mastered to sound good on consumer electronics. And you can't put good ""dense"" sound into an average stereo system. It will sound too muddy and.. just bad. So they leave the voids between the instruments and try to separate them. But on a reference headphone, this sounds... well... too reference :)Electronic music is a completely different story, this is where Beats shine! Electronic sounds are way more precise. And with Beats, you get this precision (especially in the complicated EDM tracks; I mostly listened to psytrance, psychill, idm, etc. But an average techno/trance sounds good as well). Sennheisers sound fine too, but only until you compare them with Beats.Bass: Sennheiser > Beats.The Beats are precise, again, and so is the bass. If the bass was intended in the music that you listen to - you will hear it. And you will hear exactly as much as it was planned by an artist. Rap songs sound great because of that, as well as some EDM tracks with massive sub-bass. As for the Sennheisers, well, they are v-shaped still so they add a subtle amount of bass to the overall mix, and in most cases, this sounds fine and even fun. It also comes without surprise that in bass-heavy rap songs, it starts to sound too overemphasized. In terms of precision, Sennheisers are not as precise but still hold their ground well against sony/bose/etc.Soundstage: Sennheiser > Beats.Soundstage feels subtly more open on the Sennheisers. Probably this is because they are not as precise and produce more ""parasite"" harmonics that make instruments sound further from your head. I like this effect but this makes me wonder if it's possible to achieve a good soundstage for closed headphones without compromising the sound speed and precision.ANC/Transparency: Beats > Sennheiser.Beats are slightly better in noise cancellation and noticeably better in transparency mode. Not as good as AirPods Max, but kinda close. Sennheiser is not bad though, it's just not as good. Wind can be a problem for both headphones, but I don't care. Beats are better at blocking fan noise but may overemphasize it in the transparency mode.Mic: Sennheiser >> Beats.Sennheiser microphones are superior both in terms of volume and quality. Beats is really mediocre, on the edge of what I would call ""usable"" for the zoom meetings. On top of that Beats mic sounds really quiet in Windows 11 rendering itself useless. I hope new firmware/drivers will fix that.Ergonomics: Sennheiser > Beats.I like Sennheiser more. Beats have smaller earcups with stiffer ear cushions. Also, the clamping force on my average-sized head is obnoxiously strong. Not to the point when I feel a headache after wearing them for a few hours but still too much in my opinion. However, I like the fact that Beats are more compact. It makes a difference when I listen to them in bed, for example. They don't rub as much against the pillow and don't produce a lot of noise like Sennheisers.Sennheiser ear cups are rotating 180 degrees when on the Beats, they barely move. This is important if you want to move one headphone back to open your ear when you need to listen to somebody or something from the outside world quickly. Or if you're a DJ and need to hear monitors with one of your ears :). Sennheiser earcups pivot and stay perfectly adjacent to your head, unlike the Beats.Connectivity: Beats > Sennheiser.Both headphones are ok when you're near the source, but the Beats stay connected longer as I walk away from it. The usable distance is like ~30% longer. They also perform better for a source behind a wire mesh or a security door. I know that Sennheiser is capable of working with 2 devices simultaneously and this works pretty well. Not sure about the Beats but I don't really care...Controls: Beats >> Sennheiser.Beats are very basic. They don't even have a head detection. And this feels soo good after the glitchy Sennheisers! You can read more details in other Sennheiser reviews, but they are really bad in that aspect. I bit the bullet and used them as my daily drivers, and oh boy... settings were getting changed randomly, I had tons of fantom head detection events, and when I wanted to put them on or off I almost always accidentally touched the right earcup sensor and triggered something (usually play/pause).","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2023",AHW6Y7QXQTDZZQHKFGWJCKTN66BA,True,256,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

First of all the great premium package, and the bag they bring is great. I have NEVER worn a headphone that has this sound quality, i was amazed the first time i tried them. SOUND IS CLEAR on the iPhone is everything so smooth, has automatic sync, has spatial audio, basically is a surround sound on your ears. Amazing technology for the price. My family once they tried them their reaction was priceless.So yes would i spend 400$ for this or more, definitely yes, it's a win win!, will update as i need to try them at the gym, but I'm sure they will be to notch with the ANC they transport me to pleasant land.

R2QYEYZUHZ8BFS,4.0 out of 5 stars Can’t hear my high quality headphones,Perry,4,Is it crazy to love everything about these $180 headphones but the sound? The volume Is trash. They are beautiful they look great. Comfort is about an 8 out of ten but I can hardly hear because the volume is very low. Am I missing something? Maybe I’m doing something wrong but if it is what it is than it is not very trustworthy to sell a product that doesn’t do the most important thing it was created to do. Besides the fact that I have to sit in a quiet room to actually hear on them. Is that part was different this product would get a definite 10/10 from me because the sound is crisp. The all around quality of the product is very high all the way down to the box and zipper bag it came in. The texture of them is so comforting I love it but I am definitely conflicted*update-It did get better after I plugged it into my device. Pairs easily with all my devices flawlessly.

Not very attractive, but they do an adequate job at cancelling outside noise and they have excellent sound quality. I am a music snob and I work from home. My wife also works from home and we have two teenagers that are either playing or bickering constantly. Putting on these headphones with white noise, jazz, or some other style of music allow me to completely detach from whats taking place at home and focus on my work at hand. Also, I can participate in conference calls and video chats with ease and without interruptions. When I need to practice (I am also a musician) I plug in the cord (included) to my Nord Stage 3 88 keyboard (essentially an electronic piano), and I am still oblivious to what's happening around me. Occationally, like when I have something cooking in the oven, I have the headphones on ambient mode and I can clearly hear timer in the kitchen go off. It is worth the buy if you catch it on sale.

R1HAR6IQABGEHG,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall not too bad I guess,Ashley M.,4,"I'm a stay at home mom and I was given these (my request) for mothersday. I'd like the highest level of noise cancelation to be better. I can still hear my kids when it's on, not as well as when it's off but I expected it to be better because of the price. But I enjoy there are different setting so I can hear all background noise if I need to. Sound quality is good for me. These are lacking on bass I enjoy some bass in my music so these really didn't meet that expectation. They are a bit tight like other people have said people with a larger head or ears might find them uncomfortable but I have smaller ears and head so it's good for me. The padding around the ear piece is very soft and comfortable. The padding on the head band is giving anti slip vibes but being anti slip it does pull hair a bit but it is soft and I don't feel like they are going to slide off my head if I'm moveing around. I haven't taken a phone call with them yet. Connecting to my android was extremely simple. Overall a good value for the price especially since I bought mine on sale but if you are looking for something that drowns out the entire world when you want a moment of peace maybe go with different headphones. If you don't mind hearing some noise all the time and just wanna drown out smaller back ground noise, have a small head/ears, enjoy a little less bass then these are great for the price.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AHGBWUQCNMQ2NZBJ4ZPFFNHVNCTQ,True,1,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

The only downside about the beats studios pros, is the phone call quality. Its a major step down, from the AirPods pros 2. Also, when trying to connect these to the PS5, PlayStation wireless bluetooth functionality seems to only be limited to their only products. And sadly not third parties accessories.

Bluetooth works well but will randomly switch to my iphone handset when on a call. Left earcup clicks when my jaw moves like when chewing or talking, have to make slight adjustments to where that ear cup is on my head to resolve the clicking when it happens. It is a physical issue with where the ear cup meets the band, I assume at the pivot point, causing the clicking that I’ve read many others have experienced as well.

The cushioning is a very high grade plastic which is comfortable when the headphones are being worn for hours at a time and they are secure. I wear eyeglasses and I use these headphone when I am on my laptop watching a movie or videos on Youtube. The area where the eyeglass arm rests does not hurt but my ears will get warm and I take the headphones off for a few minutes to let the air circulate at the ears to cool down, this for my use is the only negative. Otherwise these are a nice upgrade to the $60.00 or less headphones. I was able to use bluetooth to connect to my Apple devices.

RZGEO464CSXFR,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing product for the price,Eric,4,"After using the best studio pros for a while, I can definitely say that these are basically the Apple AirPod max’s but for a quarter of the price which is an amazing deal for the quality of headphones you are getting.Apple owns Beats and you get most of the features as if having AirPods and the accessibility of using them with iPhones . If you have an iPhone and pair it with the Beats Studio Pros, they will automatically pop up on your phone to connect like aipods do. Some of the same features include: being able to switch transparency/noise cancellation mode through your control center on your iPhone, Spatial Audio, Apple chip, ect. It is also lighter than Apple airpod max’s which is a huge plus for staying on your head. It includes an easy control system on the left ear on the headphones to allow you to play/pause, skip/go back, volume up/volume down, accept call/end call which is nice to be able to change the volume on the headphones which is something AirPods can’t do. They are very comfortable and sort of glue to your head and ears. You can adjust the headphones to fit to your liking as well. The color ways and the matte accent makes these headphones look slick to wear and overall they took out some small Beats decals on the previous headphones to make it look clean.Some flaws I have for the headphones are 1. That when you take them off your music will not automatically pause. This makes you take a small little step in either pausing the music on your phone, through the headphones, or continuing to play the music. I like how on the AirPods they automatically pause when you take an ear bud out so I wish these headphones did the same especially when Apple owns them. 2. They could be a tad louder. Don’t get me wrong, they are overall loud headphones but you have to get over half way in the volume to notice a loud change. Below halfway seems too quiet to me personally. 3. The case it comes in is slick, but the zipper design is annoying to get the headphones in and out of the case because the zipper hole is too small. Also the case is soft shelled and not hard so it’s not as protective as I want. 4. It’s a fingerprint magnetOverall if you are looking for high quality Bluetooth headphones, these are the best bang for your buck. Yes there are some flaws to this product, but the price is too hard to beat. These easily are the same audio quality as the airpod max if not better at quarter of the price. The design of the Beats Studio Pros have a better design than the max’s so I’d definitely suggest getting these if you want to save money.","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2024",AGNFNGIJ4UL3ZZAKLWLBZ4BGPDMQ,True,8,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22
R69R6ODYZER5R,5.0 out of 5 stars These are genuine Apple headphones!,IndianaHappyTraveler,5,"I had been delaying buying new headphones that can work with my new iPhone which no longer has an outlet to receive the connecting wire from my Sony headphones. When these went on sale at a fantastic price, both I and my husband bought them. (We are betting Apple will soon update these and have some feature we wish we would have liked, as that has happened to us before!) In any case, the headphones we packaged and shipped promptly after ordering, and arrived in perfectly new condition, and were the exact set I expected. There was 80% charge at delivery. The cord to charge was included, but I had to raid my old iPhone’s charger to actually plug it into the socket—be aware that the charging portion is NOT included in the set. This is not a big deal, as we have several chargers from older Apple products. But if you do not have Apple products, you will need to buy a charger. Both my husband and I are pleased with our new headphones and experienced no problems with the purchase and delivery of our new headphones.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AHL4MFR3WENULW7ZR2EWB2GMTUEA,True,1,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: With AppleCare+ (2 Years),B0C8PR4W22

I got these because they were one of the more affordable bluetooth headphones with pretty decent reviews (and they were on sale too). I love them! They have pretty good noise cancellation when wearing them (you can still hear some things but not so much so that it's distracting if you're trying to focus on something- working out, working, etc...) and the sound quality is pretty good. They're also pretty comfortable on my ears (they do fit good inside them though so they aren't squishing them- I'm not sure how comfortable they'd be if your ear doesn't fit inside them). They can get uncomfortable if wearing them with earrings but that's a given. All in all definitely worth the buy :))","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AEEA6TD25YHCBKT4BJT3UJ4UFYRA,True,1,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

For being ""studio pro"", this is a big downside.Trying to find a 25 foot cord that will squeeze into that hole will be a hassle for sure.Other than that the only other downside is that switching between ""eq"" settings requires you to use a double ended USB C cable and I'm not sure if that only works while listening from the cord connected device.They sound good and are comfortable though.Id be way more upset if I paid the full 350 dollars for them.Luckily I got them for half of that, so I suppose I will have to make due.","Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2024",AGMKVZMDNH6AQI4UCDPNDKO6PJMQ,True,2,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22
RTHIK4B0U8KXP,5.0 out of 5 stars Better than expected,hhoffa,5,"Everything about these are perfect so far. They cover the entirety of my ears so they don't press on the cartilage causing pain (especially since I wear glasses). They have 3 settings for sound, ""noise cancelling"", ""off"", and ""transparency"". The noise cancelling still lets sound in when nothing is playing from them, but when something is playing you can't really hear anything outside unless it's super noisy. Off makes it be just like a regular pair of headphones, and transparency is actually pretty amazing- put them on, nothing playing, and in this mode you can hear everything almost as perfectly as if you didn't have them on. When music is playing you can still hear some stuff from outside, but you still have to pause it to hear what someone is saying though.I bought an off brand pair of headphones for $25 in October and the pairing and ease of use was actually kind of complicated. BUT THESE. These are so simple, I love it. They also connected right away.My only gripe is maybe it could stay on the top of my head better, but I think that's because of how fine/thin my hair is and everything just falls off it. It's great that it's smooth, but because of it, even the gripper thing on the head part can't compete with my hair 😂(I own an android and forever will, these work great with them despite being an ""apple product"")","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2024",AHZFNBRVXADZFCDDK3RTOOR7TL2Q,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

They were a bit stiff and uncomfortable at first, but after a few days of wearing they stretched out a bit to fit comfortably over my head. The active noise canceling is excellent.They do lack a key feature that I had with my JBL headphones. I cannot pair to 2 devices at the same time. I work from home several days a week and am on a lot of Zoom meetings. In between meetings, I listen to music on my phone. I end up having to either toggle back and forth between devices or listen to Spotify from my laptop. Workable, but not ideal. Additionally, there is no tone to indicate that I successfully turned on the headphones. I can’t always tell if they are on unless they pair to a device. This doesn’t always happen automatically (probably because I regularly toggle between 2 devices). It is for this reason that these headphones only get 4 stars.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2024",AG2PSIOBFWMROA4RRNFO6Z6IRIKA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

I wanted something to block out the little noises and hustle and bustle when I study in the library, in a coffee shop, at home, or outside. I read a lot of reviews from different sites and watched videos about the beast pro before I committed to them. What was important for me besides the sound quality was how good the noise canceling was. Many said that for the price it was a good head set for its quality, it was equal to the the quiet comfort 45 Bose headphones.Now the sound quality in my opinion is good, I will say though that for classical and R&B music it doesn’t give it justice. You can hear the music just fine but when you are in a noisy environment, even with noise cancellation, you have to put up the volume to hear lower and softer melodies. For more up beat music the music sounds better especially like pop, rap, country, etc. There isn’t a lot of base but you can control it’s sound, you just have to have the iPhone 11 or 12 and up to do that, I have an SE 2nd gen.The opinion that I have asked of others are an overall 7/10The battery life is amazing, it last for long periods of time, for 10 hrs of music straight the battery holds to a good percentage. If I hear for a few hrs of music a day for a week, I don’t have to charge it until the next week. And it charges so quickly too, it takes up to 30 min to charge full.I like how it have its own pouch to store it in with its adapters and charger, and have an extra zipper pocket to store in anything extra.Overall these a pretty good headphones if you don’t want to spend over $300 for a pair.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024",AFJACG5ME2ZWJUUIUIXBOYBEYPKQ,True,6,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

R32E8G89RQ9WL4,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound but build quality could be better,Thomas,4,"I have bought several pairs of these over generations. Now, you can say well that’s a good sign you liked them or that’s a bad sign you needed to buy more and both statements are true. As far as sound and usability and just about everything else these are great in my opinion. Where they fall short is build quality. I will give them a slight pass on the fact that I guess my head is a little on the large size but two thing that inevitably ends up happening with every set of these earlier than it should. Usually around the 1 year mark or sometimes a little more with the pads being the first to go. The ear pads wear out way too easily especially if they get moist at all by your sweat or anything else. They detest moisture of any sort and will breakdown. They are going to breakdown anyway but this will expediate the process. The second problem is where they are hinged by the ears. The hinges bear a little more pressure than they would like to and ultimately the hinge plate covers pop off and then the last failure point which was usually around the 2 year mark or so for me was the hinge itself. I put tape around the hinges when the plates popped off to extend the life a bit. I always get these when they are on sale so overall I find it to be acceptable as evidenced by my re purchases but they really should update their QC / Material game. If you were paying the full price for these you might not appreciate how quickly they can give out mechanically. Which that said, again, those with a smaller head my get more mileage but keep in mind I never considered myself to have a large head until I got these :).","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AH4DQBYFPZCYCIPZX3O6MFEKGHPA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

I personally did not like this item because the music sounded funny not clear kinda like if you need to pop your ears after going up a mountain. They were also very tight around my head so i had to take breaks using them because it would hurt my ears. The charging is fast. They are stable and they were pretty easy to use. The buttons were responsive. They are pretty good if you haven't tried airpods pro. Beats were not it for me but if you don't care just listening to music then they will be a great choice for you.,"Reviewed in the United States April 15, 2024",AFPPLMY3643EDC4H2Y7PVOBFDPBQ,True,0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

R19FNCEBWTLWCK,5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable and Noise Canceling!,Zack,5,"These headphones are everything I dreamed they'd be. Many people have told me I could find the same quality or better for cheaper, which may or may not be true, but I'm honestly glad I got these. (They were on sale anyway).Even though I might agree they're overpriced, they really are outstanding. I don't know that much about sound quality, and the differences that exist between products, but if I could describe the sound coming out of these headphones: I feel like I can hear every cord on guitars, every beat on drums, and the very vibration in my favorite artists' voice while they're singing. This is of course all further improved by seemless noise canceling.Obviously, it would not be possible to block out every sound (like the insanely loud truck horns when I go outside to take the trash out), but I will say my family members have had to SHOUT to get my attention at times lol. And I mean they were seriously screaming bloody murder. I really don't hear anything but music when I have these things on and in noise cancelling mode. In fact, at one point I had them in transparency mode without realizing and I could hear the ambient noises coming from TV still (which is what alerted me to them not being in noise cancelling), so I switched them back in the app and the sound from my TV was cut out completely in a second. I'm not going to lie, it impressed me. Maybe I'm easy to impress.I could probably go on and on about these, but bottom line: yes they are an overpriced brand name and not the only good product you could get, but if you do decide to buy them you won't be disappointed or feel it's a waste of money. If you want to splurge and treat yourself, these headphones are a safe choice.And hey, if you're filthy rich, what do I care what you do with your money?","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2023",AHSQFTDH4ON7KJQS5YF6JMRUHASQ,True,19,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

I do sometimes have some trouble with where they sit on the top of my head after a while if it's in a certain spot, but overall I've been able to wear them for hours at a time cleaning the house or sitting and listening to music and I think they've been great. I wanted them to be able to pair easily with my iphone which they do, and the main purpose I bought them for was to be able to wear them while on walks and still be able to hear my surroundings. The passthrough feature is pretty good, although I did notice that wind noise is a bit loud with 2 of the 3 noise cancellation settings, but not terrible. I also saw people complaining that it was hard to tell which setting you are on, but the sounds are very different for each so if you just quickly memorize which is associated with the appropriate setting, it's really not hard at all to know which one you are on based on the sound.

R2X5RBKVPANSSN,"5.0 out of 5 stars I didn't need them, stopped myself a few times, but broke down and bought them and so glad I did.",movin and groovin,5,"I already have original Airpod Pros that I like a lot, although I've gone thru 5 plus replacements due to a cracking noise. I also had some older Bose wired noise cancelling that worked really well and the AirPod Studio are too expensive, A few month back I read an article comparing the Beats Studio with the AirPod Studios. They both have outstanding features and the report gave the Beats a slight advantage. I saw the Beats Studio on sale a couple of times and was tempted to buy, but talked myself out of it. Then Amazon had their October Prime days sale and on the second day these were at a really really good price. So I bought them with one rule to myself. I couldn't open the box until I sold the Bose on Ebay, which happened pretty quickly, so I ended up paying less than $100 after selling my Bose. I opened the box, put them on a good charge and used them every day for almost 2 weeks before needing a charge. I use them for watching tv and they sound fantastic. They are really good at noise cancellation and Spacial Audio sound better than my AirPod Pros. Love that I can go a looooong time between charges. The AirPod lasted around 4 hours. These can go up to 40. The only complaint is that the padding is not as soft as the Bose and after 3 hours or so, I would have to pull them off and let the top of my ears get a rest from the pressure. The other complaint is that when I'm out walking my dog, there is a very loud buffeting noise on windy days. It's just the shape of the headphones and probably happens on most full size headphones.These use USB-C cables so I plugged them into my Macbook Pro using USB-C and played some lossless music from Apple Music and WOW. I love listening to older music from the 70s and it really has great bass. I've been turning off noise cancelling/transparent mode to get longer life and it has been about 3 weeks of use with only one recharge.One thing is that the carrying case is a bit thicker than the Bose so they might not fit in my favorite carry on bag for my ipod and other gadgets that I can't live without when flying. Overall I'm super happy with these.","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2023",AHERDTMZMWFVE45UI5OQLOPT3JZQ,True,123,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

R3Q0KCRF9CILPE,5.0 out of 5 stars My first high end pair of headphones and they're amazing,Lisa Smith,5,"Not only have I never owned headphones that cost more than $15, ive never owned wireless headphones nor the kind that go over your head....so I may be biased with my review having no experience with any other headphones on the level of the Beats Studio Pro. They are amazing, and totally surpassed my expectations.The reason I used to only buy ear buds (the kind that have those rubber peices that go deep into your ear) was because I thought that was the only way to get good quality sound and lots of base. I like to dance to fast paced pop music and sweat to the oldies and have my music LOUD. I always assumed ear muff type of headphones would make most of the music/volume escape around the sides. But I was so wrong, these Beats headphones make it sound like you're at the club, or like the music is being performed in the room with you...I heard things in my music that I've never heard before; a subtle drum or base in the background that I didn't know was there, a background singer adding a note at a certain point...And yet it didn't change the song but enhanced it. I didn't know music could sound like this! I'm 32 and kicking myself for not investing in a nice pair of headphones all these years. I dont see how it could get better than this. If you love music, like really love listening to music, you need to have these! Oh, and the 'transparency mode' blew my mind. It actually works and I have no idea how. Charge lasts for weeks (listening to music about an hour or 2 a day). I guess the only downfall is keeping them clean, though I'm sure there's a product out there for that.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2024",AFQHYSP2HWNWRTFYZ25WP2SFJ3FA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,B0C8PR4W22

I rewatched ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"" with them, and there was an entire track of background noise that I never knew existed! It was a totally different movie with such great sound! The ear cups are soft and buttery, and feel nice against the skin. The noise cancelation works really good and it's nice to have the transparent option. It really holds a charge for DAYS!Basically, two problems, but I'm not saying they're not nice.

The sound quality is a good neutral range, with it being a rather flat in the frequency response, but with some extra sound in the treble. It’s not a bad thing, it’s more reminiscent of the Beats Solo Pro. That said though, in plain terms it means if you want a more bass heavy set of headphones, then this might not be the best for you. There isn’t any noise cancelling either, though personally I don’t mind too much as I don’t prefer active noise cancelling. There is spatial head tracking though, and it’s pretty fun to play with.I do like the case and how it’s pretty portable. It fits easily into a small backpack, and the battery life lasts as long as you do really. I listen to music frequently throughout the day, and I can honestly go a few days, specifically 3-4 depending on use, without needing to charge. I can see this also being good for traveling as well because of it. It’s also a nice looking pair of headphones, and built with quality materials. It feels sturdy on me, and while I mostly use it at home, I would feel comfortable walking with it places.Overall, I’d recommend for a decent daily driver headphone.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AH35JWVQOH6GNEOZ5AXBB7EH5S3A,True,1,Color: Cloud PinkStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+,B0CZPLV566

REIPQVD8YAH6R,5.0 out of 5 stars The color though 😍😍😍,Chels L,5,I have an unnatural obsession with the color blue and this shade of blue is everything!!! I was hesitant to get these cause the reviews weren’t great… but most of the negative reviews are because of the shade of the pink ones… not the quality of headphones. The blue is true to the advertised shade. All the buttons are responsive. The headphones fit well and offer an adjustable fit. They aren’t noise canceling technically… buy they might as well be lol. The sound quality is pretty good. I’ve had them for about a month now and charged them as soon as I opened the box… I used them every day and I still have 43% battery remaining.,"Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2024",AGOYSEXQTNTOTHCGCJLLTJ6F7H2A,True,2,Color: Slate BlueStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+,B0CZPLV566

RXZ0DLQGMO41,3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound. Impossible to wear for long.,Ronald Ellis,3,"I had high hopes for this item. Had great reviews.I really liked the sound. It's not in the 'top notch' category, but it's excellent for the price. The battery life is really incredible....40+ hours...wow. Although I wish I had read the fine print, and assumed that most Apple type products have the 'sound through' option, or touching a button and being able to hear externally. This one's on me for not checking.The only issue (a big one), is that these are EXTREMELY uncomfortable on your ears for more than a short amount of time. I wore them for about 2 hours on a plane to watch a movie, and kept fidgeting with them for comfort. When I arrived, on the bus trip to the destination, I really thought that I had an ear infection from how achy one of my ears was. It faded after an hour or so, but the cushions are so small that they can only sit on top of the ears, not around them. Just didn't work for me.I tried to give them to one of my daughters with smaller ears, and she refused within 15 minutes as she could tell immediately that they would hurt over time.This is just an FYI for anyone who might consider these. Short term, awesome, long term, no no. My advice is that if you are in the market for headphones, save your pennies for the higher end over the ears.","Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2024",AHONXEWM6GVKYOCZNUQ2VR3GG5SQ,True,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+,B0CZPLV566

ROO2X7JY6YNRG,3.0 out of 5 stars I Really Wanted to Like These,J. Caruso,3,"I have always been one to ignore Beats headphones, but recently, I decided to try a pair of the Beats Studio Pros because they were on an irresistible sale. I was more impressed with them than I thought, even with some of their shortcomings.Which is why I decided to give the new Solo 4s a try. For me, these simply didn't have enough for me to keep them in my collection, particularly given that I own the Studio Pros.Recently, I have become a fan of on-ear headphones (as distinct from over-ear). I own the Skullcandy Riff 2, the Sony WH-CH520, and the JBL Live 670. The Solo 4s are the only ones I've returned. And it's not because they were so offensive or horrible; they simply didn't add anything to my collection.First of all, the clamping force was inordinately tight for my head. Normally, this doesn't bother me. But these simply were too uncomfortable from the moment I put them on, and they only got worse the longer I wore them.Then there was the sound. Like I said, I own the Beats Studio Pros, and have an appreciation for what they are and what they do. Even though they don't have the ability to be EQed, which I prefer, I like them in and of themselves and enjoy the sound they provide. The Solo 4s are similar in that they are a what-you-get-is-what-you-get sound. In this case, however, I found myself wishing for an equalizer. They sounded thin and harsh, not full like the Studio Pros.When I compared them to my other Bluetooth headphones, I couldn't justify keeping them in the collection. To be fair, there was a lot to like about them: the iPhone and Android compatibility, the folding design, the carrying case, and the look/style. However, the comfort and sound were just too much of a negative for me.I can see that many people will like these a lot, and I'm glad. They fill a niche and they fill it well. But for me, there are just too many other options I like better.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AF6PWT7PYEOVDQDJQX5Q64767SNQ,True,45,Color: Cloud PinkStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+,B0CZPLV566

The charging cable that comes with it will need an additional connection so just get it. i wasnt thrilled about that! be sure and read carefully. i thought who doesnt include USB chargers now?? The black case included is so hard to get hand in that I almost broke headphones getting them out. I am a small woman and could barely get my hand in? why? adding a couple of inches to the zipper would have been so nice. i will have to switch out the case with my retiring Beats 3.

R1H90ALSTZQCMY,"4.0 out of 5 stars Comfy, but audio requires equalizer adjustment",Customer,4,"I'll start by saying that these fit well and are very comfortable to wear. The construction is high quality, and the materials feel and look great. They also have no issue staying on when exercising, and don't stick too far out from the ears.Battery life is also great, even when only used in noise canceling mode. I only use mine for about an hour at time when working out, but so far I've only had to charge a few times.My main complaint is that out of the box, the audio is incredibly underwhelming. Very shallow and drowned out, and it feels like the gain is *way* down, so it's rather quiet at max volume. I'm able to hear my feet on the treadmill with the default audio at high volume, even in noise canceling. This is mitigated by using the equalizer included in my phone software, but not every phone has that option and even fewer people would know how to do it. So these aren't terribly user friendly in that regard.Then theres the required Beats app. The app doesn't offer any real utility; no audio presets or way to adjust the headphones beyond registering for warranty, changing the hardware name, or buying more beats products... So that's a bit useless bloat.For the high price tag I think there are better options. But these are still competitive, and if you're already in the Beats ecosphere, these are fine.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHSVWQZPUMOQAHBOO5LYG2RIFUSA,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+,B0CZPLV566
RVM3XGRJLQGOK,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Battery Life but Sound Quality Could be Better,Replica,4,"Pros:Physical Control ButtonsLong Battery LifeAmazing Bluetooth RangeNatural Noise IsolationCons:Sound quality does not match priceNo Active Noise CancellingThe Beats Solo 4 are good but not great headphones. The sound quality is not bad but was disappointing at this price point. Compared to the Sony WH-CH720N, they sound thin and hollow. The highs come through nicely but mid range is not as strong in the mix. The bass is nicely balanced, not overpowering like other Beats headphones I have tried.Where the Beats Solo 4 headphones excel is in the battery life that last longer than any other wireless headphones I have used. The Bluetooth range was also amazingly good. I often forget my phone somewhere while walking around the house on the phone or listening to music, causing the signal to start dropping out. I was able to go everywhere in my house with these on without any degradation to the sound. I am a big fan of the physical buttons. They do what I expect when I click them. I always have trouble with touch buttons registering the correct number of clicks.At this price, I would have expected the Beats Solo 4 to have the Active Noise Cancelling feature, which is missing. They do fit snugly and naturally block a lot of outside noises. The Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking only works on Apple devices even though that feature is available on Android with other headphones.Call quality has been good. No one I have called has mentioned that I sound different so I take that to mean that it works as well as my usual ear buds. I like having the option for the 3.5 audio cable to use on certain planes. The headphones fold down into a nice case. It is still a little large when traveling, but not much more than others.The Beats Solo 4 are decent headphones with some nice features. They are not a good value at MSRP, but that could change when they are on sale.","Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2024",AEOFSOVSHRAVZ5DUAD7ZNCGIEZCA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: Solo4Set: Without AppleCare+,B0CZPLV566
